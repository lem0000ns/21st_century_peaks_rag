[00:00] the first episodes of this series have
[00:02] been about
[00:03] big men because the game was built for
[00:05] their dominance back then
[00:06] less spacing and no three-pointer placed
[00:09] a premium on
[00:10] rim protection and on interior scoring
[00:13] there were a few non-bigs who could hang
[00:15] with the giants
[00:16] julius erving's aerial wizardry earned
[00:18] him the mvp in 1981
[00:20] and oscar robertson won the award in
[00:22] 1964 as a 6'5 guard
[00:25] but larry bird was like none of these
[00:28] players
[00:29] he was something entirely unique that
[00:31] the basketball world had never seen
[00:33] before
[00:34] and hasn't seen since you are
[00:37] watching what greatness is all about
[00:40] where's larry bird in all this
[00:44] [Applause]
[00:48] this series tackles one question who was
[00:50] the best
[00:51] at his best we started the aba merger
[00:54] and go through the best
[00:55] multi-year stretches examining the
[00:57] legends who provided the most
[00:59] on court impact these are the greatest
[01:03] peaks
[01:10] seven minutes
[01:16] bird burst onto the scene in the 80s
[01:19] with his own brand of basketball alchemy
[01:22] at six nine he could play in the post
[01:24] but was also a world-class outside
[01:26] shooter who could pass
[01:28] let's start with the most basic part of
[01:30] this equation his post game
[01:32] bird's most traditional back to the
[01:34] basket move was a lefty hook
[01:36] he loved physicality note the little hip
[01:39] check to claim
[01:40] space and he could roll this over most
[01:42] offenders
[01:43] if it wasn't available he'd start head
[01:45] faking opponents into some wild finishes
[01:48] and larry would throw combinations
[01:50] fainting right then to the middle
[01:52] only to step through and then what is
[01:54] that reverse off the window
[01:56] this fakes like a jab that softens his
[01:58] man and then this
[01:59] crazy rainbow from two feet and he was
[02:02] constantly manipulating defenders with
[02:04] the ball like this to open up tiny nooks
[02:07] he could work with
[02:08] at times it felt hypnotic like charles
[02:11] xavier whispering in defenders heads
[02:13] where are you going this is
[02:16] choreographed embarrassment because
[02:18] bird had the league shook with his
[02:20] shooting and they were on high alert
[02:22] because he could rock you in your face
[02:24] with this
[02:24] quick fadeaway this was larry's money
[02:27] maker in these spots and
[02:29] like most of his game it was quick
[02:31] hitting catching defenders off guard by
[02:33] flowing right into the release
[02:35] he's already started the move here
[02:37] before catching it
[02:39] and bird even turned that fade away into
[02:41] the og step back at times
[02:43] kiki vandaway is often credited with
[02:45] popularizing the move with this little
[02:47] two-step
[02:48] but bird was the first star to unleash
[02:50] it regularly
[02:51] and certainly with sharper footwork than
[02:53] kiki
[02:54] it served larry well because defenders
[02:56] respected his fakes
[02:58] and he was comfortable falling away
[03:00] you'll notice that a bunch of these are
[03:02] long
[03:02] twos birds first coach bill fitch
[03:05] discouraged three pointers
[03:06] and it wasn't until about 1985 that
[03:08] larry started launching more than one
[03:10] per game
[03:12] bird was pretty much the best all-around
[03:15] shooter of that era
[03:16] sprinkling in a variety of outside
[03:18] jumpers and no one could match his 90
[03:21] free throw shooting and 40 3-point
[03:24] shooting
[03:25] although his volume from deep was low
[03:27] steph curry takes
[03:29] more threes in a typical season than
[03:31] bird did from 1984 to 1987
[03:33] combined and so it's not totally clear
[03:36] how much
[03:36] long ball larry left on the scoreboard
[03:39] from 85 to 87 larry was far more
[03:42] effective from downtown versus weaker
[03:45] defenses
[03:46] probably because they left him open in
[03:47] these spots more like he was just a
[03:49] normal player
[03:51] against defense is at least two points
[03:53] worse than league
[03:54] average bird shot 47 percent on three
[03:58] attempts every 36 minutes
[04:00] but against defense's two points ahead
[04:02] of league average
[04:03] he shot only 34 with a hefty dip
[04:06] in volume some of this is likely noise
[04:08] but his attempts also dropped in the
[04:11] playoffs during his peak years
[04:12] so i'm not sure how comfortable he was
[04:14] just manufacturing threes
[04:17] 
[04:17] despite mangling his finger in a college
[04:19] softball game
[04:21] he had good touch on all kinds of little
[04:23] floaters and flips headed to the hoop
[04:26] he did this with both hands regularly
[04:28] making horse shots like this
[04:30] and he was dexterous enough to make all
[04:32] kinds of off-balance leaners too
[04:35] but these shots were born out of
[04:36] necessity remember that rainbow from two
[04:39] feet earlier
[04:40] it's because bird has no explosion at
[04:42] the rim he often uses his body as a
[04:45] shield to find a cleaner release
[04:47] even left-handed and these contortions
[04:49] were to make up for a lack of
[04:51] verticality
[04:52] bird actually missed a ton of layups oh
[04:55] it's walton uh where was i yes
[04:58] the the miss bunnies he often took one
[05:01] dribble in these spots instead of
[05:02] getting all the way to the rim
[05:04] for a loaded up contest because even at
[05:07] six
[05:07] nine he was at a disadvantage against
[05:10] biggs ready to jump
[05:12] you may know that legendary game in
[05:14] portland where he played left-handed
[05:16] this is mostly a tall tale because he
[05:18] regularly needed his left hand to finish
[05:21] here in the post he's going southpaw for
[05:23] a cleaner look
[05:24] because he's carved out space to his
[05:26] left and can't explode at the rim or
[05:28] leap over defenders
[05:30] this rim finishing is bird's real
[05:33] glaring wart as a scorer
[05:35] and his inability to finish into or
[05:37] through size and contact
[05:39] was a reason why his free throw rate was
[05:41] never great the upfake frees him but
[05:43] even against mediocre rim protection
[05:45] he avoids contact to find a layup here
[05:49] he spins clear but resorts to a floater
[05:51] from
[05:51] point blank range at his apex bird was a
[05:55] huge regular season score 28 points per
[05:57] 75
[05:58] untrue shooting percentage seven percent
[06:01] ahead of the league
[06:02] but his best three-year stretch as a
[06:04] playoff scorer
[06:06] from 1984 to 1986 was closer to 24
[06:09] points per 75 on plus
[06:11] 5 efficiency we see a similar story in
[06:15] the regular season against stronger
[06:16] defenses using those splits from earlier
[06:19] his scoring dipped from nearly 27 points
[06:21] per 75
[06:23] down to under 23 with a drop in
[06:26] efficiency
[06:27] this is still good production but the
[06:29] drop-off is on the larger side for
[06:31] high-end scorers
[06:32] and i think it speaks to bird's
[06:34] inability to generate easy shots against
[06:36] stronger defenses
[06:38] what those numbers don't capture is his
[06:41] scoring flexibility
[06:43] constantly moving without the basketball
[06:45] look at all these tricks
[06:46] to shed bobby jones an all-time defender
[06:49] and these cuts force attention that
[06:51] opens a post up on one block and on the
[06:54] other
[06:55] and the move is quick and that's classic
[06:57] bird
[06:59] his shooting means you have to chase him
[07:01] and his post game leads to denials but
[07:03] then he counter cuts and that is a slick
[07:06] finish
[07:07] bird was an expert at finding little
[07:10] cracks in the defense like this
[07:12] not at layups and you can see this
[07:14] perfectly in transition
[07:16] here bird likes to float to the wing for
[07:18] three but as the ball turns the corner
[07:20] bird knows that brings help and basket
[07:23] cuts right behind it
[07:24] and of course he makes that nonsense
[07:27] he relentlessly pursued advantages did
[07:30] you catch it
[07:31] the ball is reversed so he swings his
[07:33] leg across his defender to seal and go
[07:36] a good passer hits him for layup there
[07:38] but that's okay because the attention
[07:40] allows a clear iso touch for robert
[07:42] parish bird's off ball game lets him
[07:45] fit next to other great scorers who need
[07:47] the rock like kevin mchale
[07:49] but it also helps him mesh with good
[07:51] passers who learn to see what bird sees
[07:54] larry slows down here to keep his man
[07:57] outside of an empty paint
[07:58] and dennis johnson turns that into a
[08:00] bunny
[08:02] they had this read down and it's
[08:04] possible because
[08:05] all these defenders are worried about
[08:06] bird curling up for an open shot
[08:09] this made helping off bird difficult and
[08:12] he parlayed that activity into
[08:14] fantastic offensive rebounding rooting
[08:17] inside players when they were on the
[08:18] wrong side of him
[08:20] he anticipated shots and would sneak
[08:22] into position
[08:23] look at that work to get inside someone
[08:25] else's man
[08:26] and he was more comfortable finishing
[08:28] these after sealing off opponents
[08:30] but for all of his movement and absurd
[08:32] shot making there was another ingredient
[08:35] to larry bird's alchemy
[08:36] that transformed him into an offensive
[08:39] legend
[08:42] 
[08:42] it's one thing to fly off screens as a
[08:44] threat to shoot
[08:46] but bird supercharged his value by
[08:48] seamlessly audibling those two passes
[08:51] he may have been the best passer on the
[08:53] move in nba history
[08:55] and that meant scoring routes turned
[08:57] into layups for teammates
[09:00] larry blurred shots into passes and
[09:03] punished defensive reactions to his
[09:05] movement like this
[09:06] and he never stopped the ball even on a
[09:08] simple extra pass like this he adds the
[09:10] screen because he's a step ahead
[09:13] there's so much anticipation to his game
[09:16] this is like a touch entry pass
[09:18] already knowing robert parrish's right
[09:20] hand is the soft spot in the defense
[09:23] of course that made him a touch pass
[09:25] master
[09:26] and this means you have to know where
[09:28] pieces are before the ball arrives
[09:30] he knows perishes the mark the whole way
[09:32] down the court
[09:34] obviously this vision made bird deadly
[09:37] in transition before defenses were set
[09:40] too good says don nelson any teammates
[09:43] willing to run with bird benefited from
[09:45] his attention
[09:46] and the delivery on some of these passes
[09:48] would make ups jealous
[09:51] this clip's blurry but you can still see
[09:53] the whole package patiently waiting for
[09:55] a cutter to fill the lane
[09:56] holding the defense by looking away then
[09:59] snapping a strike to the streaking
[10:00] walton
[10:02] we've discussed byrd's manipulation of
[10:04] defenders with the ball
[10:06] but his go-to trick was the shot pass
[10:08] where
[10:09] he drew coverage and created better
[10:11] passing angles
[10:13] pick and roll wasn't a big part of his
[10:15] game then but he ran it more in 86 and
[10:17] 87
[10:18] and that ball fake was so good it
[10:20] distracted mikael
[10:21] too in the half court larry's on ball
[10:24] passing typically stemmed from his back
[10:26] to the basket game
[10:28] he welcomed double teams in these spots
[10:30] and could skip it over defensive
[10:31] rotations
[10:32] or he would just gut teams who weren't
[10:34] disciplined about doubling off cutters
[10:37] when he had a step he could make tight
[10:39] laydown passes with the best of them
[10:41] drawing defenders in for a shot pass and
[10:44] knowing where his teammate would
[10:46] be bird wasn't a perfect passer
[10:49] besides some limitations off the bounce
[10:51] he could be a bit out of sync on his
[10:53] entry passes at times
[10:55] like many greats he took all kinds of
[10:57] chances and was too aggressive on some
[10:59] of them
[11:00] and every once in a while he'd miss an
[11:01] advanced layup pass he probably had
[11:04] danny ainge there
[11:05] and coming down on this fast break the
[11:07] first look is open
[11:09] but of course bird is so good he sends
[11:11] it home anyway
[11:13] finally the man was the best outlet
[11:15] passer i've
[11:16] ever seen these weren't simply about
[11:19] starting fast breaks
[11:20] they spawned layups out of thin air
[11:24] bird was always thinking about the next
[11:25] possession as the ball went through the
[11:27] net
[11:28] and how to exploit a defense's backline
[11:31] age is closing to the corner here
[11:33] and bird still thinks to instantly look
[11:35] for him on a fly pattern
[11:37] after this make that's just absurd
[11:41] all of this made him the second best
[11:43] playmaker of the 1980s
[11:45] we'll get to the best of the next
[11:46] episode making life
[11:48] easier for his teammates in a variety of
[11:50] ways
[11:51] he even turned loose balls into easy
[11:53] points ready to drop dimes from his back
[11:56] when he dove on the floor
[11:58] and all of this helped drive boston's
[12:00] offense to elite heights
[12:02] from 1984 to 88 the celtics efficiency
[12:05] was 5 points per 100 better than league
[12:08] average
[12:08] one of the 10 best stretches ever so
[12:12] despite birds post-season scoring
[12:14] hiccups boston's
[12:15] playoff offenses were quite similar 11th
[12:18] best among teams was stretches like this
[12:21] even with kevin mchale out for over 30
[12:23] games from 1986 to 88
[12:26] boston's offense was six points ahead of
[12:28] the league
[12:29] behind bird and company evidence of his
[12:31] colossal
[12:32] impact his constant movement
[12:36] and high motor translated to the
[12:37] defensive end too
[12:39] after hopping around here until he found
[12:41] open pasture
[12:42] bird hightails it back to prevent a fast
[12:45] break
[12:45] and larry's defensive preference during
[12:47] the peak of his career
[12:49] was helping off his man in the paint to
[12:51] plug gaps or
[12:52] double team when needed that court
[12:55] vision
[12:55] served him well in this role he's
[12:57] rotating the second his guard gets a
[12:59] step
[13:00] and bird's wild jab alters it just
[13:02] enough
[13:03] his lack of lift made these help
[13:05] attempts only marginally effective
[13:07] he often rotated in time but he wasn't
[13:09] springy enough to really swallow up
[13:11] shots
[13:12] but basketball is a game of percentages
[13:15] and
[13:16] bird's constant presence was just enough
[13:18] to turn layups into misses at times
[13:21] and sometimes these reactions helped
[13:23] make plays a touch easier for his
[13:24] teammates
[13:27] larry was just there constantly and at 6
[13:30] 9 was large enough in spots to protect
[13:32] the rim
[13:33] fairly well for a forward he had a small
[13:36] block radius and would offer
[13:38] little resistance if caught flat footed
[13:41] but
[13:41] bird also made a surprising number of
[13:43] stands at the hoop
[13:44] here stonewalling a young michael jordan
[13:47] just like an above average
[13:49] big wood only bird played small
[13:52] forward in a lot of these lineups so his
[13:54] paint presence became a solid positive
[13:56] next to two other bigs his incredible
[13:59] hand-eye coordination allowed him to
[14:01] target blocks as the ball was released
[14:03] and he averaged about a block per game
[14:05] during these peak seasons
[14:08] he also augmented his rim protection by
[14:10] taking charges before it was in vogue
[14:13] and his early positioning and
[14:15] out-guessing games
[14:16] forced turnovers on drives like this now
[14:20] bird has been historically panned for
[14:22] his band defense but i actually don't
[14:24] think it was too damaging
[14:25] he was a touch too eager at times and
[14:28] could succumb to
[14:28] upfakes but against most big forwards of
[14:31] that day he held his own
[14:34] on the outside bird's slow foot speed
[14:37] was a bit of an issue against slashers
[14:39] but basketball was played inside 18 feet
[14:42] back then
[14:43] so even with those clunky steps teams
[14:45] couldn't really
[14:46] punish him this was a fairly typical man
[14:49] possession for him
[14:50] over playing the drive and throwing up a
[14:52] decent contest
[14:54] although just like in the post he could
[14:56] get into hot water
[14:57] biting on up fakes in these spots here's
[15:00] 
[15:01] larry using mind games against a
[15:03] dangerous guard
[15:04] jabbing toward the ball and then playing
[15:06] the drive left
[15:07] and his reflexes were insane his hands
[15:10] are down when this
[15:11] pass is thrown and those reflexes made
[15:14] bird a playmaker around the ball
[15:17] making little kick out passes difficult
[15:19] like a hockey goalie deflecting pucks
[15:21] out of the air
[15:23] he also turned basic entry passes into
[15:26] an adventure at times
[15:27] with what looked like a sort of
[15:29] basketball spidey sense
[15:31] those hands were strong and quick with
[15:34] nasa-like precision and if you blinked
[15:37] you'd miss their magic
[15:38] at times and this phenomenal
[15:41] coordination
[15:42] made that low block tactic possible and
[15:44] it also made his post doubles really
[15:46] effective
[15:47] ambushing unsuspecting big men
[15:50] here's a possession roaming off his mark
[15:53] on the perimeter
[15:54] trying to disrupt action and then
[15:56] bouncing around the edge of the paint
[15:58] plugging gaps here it's this cutter
[16:01] because the spot up 3 wasn't a threat
[16:02] then
[16:03] and of course those hands made the
[16:05] double team effective
[16:07] there's a cat and mouse quality to some
[16:09] of his possessions where he's hoping to
[16:11] induce a mistake instead of just playing
[16:13] it straight up
[16:14] so bird's tail are made for zoning up
[16:17] two players like this
[16:18] where he can read a passer's eyes and it
[16:21] all makes sense that the most memorable
[16:23] play of his career
[16:24] is a steal birds eyeing this pass before
[16:28] isaiah thomas had the ball isaiah has
[16:30] said he never even saw larry here
[16:32] and then of course a layup pass with
[16:34] three seconds left
[16:35] and big red cannot believe what he just
[16:38] saw
[16:39] most of bird's defensive tricks weren't
[16:42] big gambles but
[16:43] sometimes he did whiff so there was a
[16:46] minor tax to pay
[16:47] for his level of aggression but larry
[16:50] rarely made errors or
[16:52] missed key rotations he'd usually pounce
[16:54] in help situations like this
[16:56] and overall i think it's easy to see why
[16:58] he made consecutive all defensive teams
[17:01] from 1982 to 1984.
[17:04] this value bubbles up when we look at
[17:06] bird's handful of missed games in 1987
[17:08] and 1988
[17:09] the celtics were only a point per game
[17:11] better than their opponents without bird
[17:13] or roughly a 45 win pace but with him
[17:16] they were plus 7
[17:18] or a 61 win pace the changes in 1989
[17:22] when larry missed the entire season were
[17:24] nearly identical
[17:26] perhaps more notable is what happened
[17:28] when mchale missed large chunks of time
[17:31] the celtics were a 64 win team with
[17:33] kevin and without him they played at a
[17:35] 57 win pace in 31 games
[17:38] that means that boston was still a
[17:40] borderline championship
[17:42] team without mchale yet maxed out as an
[17:45] all-time team at 67 wins
[17:47] because bird could fit next to a star
[17:49] who ostensibly played his own position
[17:52] that's incredibly impressive to me and
[17:55] evidence that he's one of the most
[17:56] scalable players
[17:57] ever able to fit next to a variety of
[18:00] high-end talent
[18:02] our historical all-in-one metrics are
[18:04] quite high
[18:05] on his peak especially this version of
[18:08] box plus minus that's more sensitive to
[18:10] his playmaking
[18:11] impact we should also note that some of
[18:13] his value comes from
[18:14] strong defensive rebounding and he was
[18:16] always looking to throw a body on

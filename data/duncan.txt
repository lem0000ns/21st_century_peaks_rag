[00:00] in this series we've seen two types of
[00:02] big men
[00:03] the first anchored the defense while
[00:05] playing a kind of co-pilot role on
[00:07] offense the second dominated with their
[00:10] team's attack
[00:11] orbiting around their incredible scoring
[00:14] which brings us to the final great big
[00:16] man
[00:16] in this series was tim duncan more of an
[00:20] offensive centerpiece
[00:21] or did his crafty low post scoring game
[00:25] and suffocating interior defense make
[00:28] him the very best
[00:29] of the two-way big men you are watching
[00:33] what
[00:33] greatness is all about where's larry
[00:36] bird in all this
[00:38] how's it blocked by elijah michael
[00:41] jordan
[00:41] saves the day this series tackles one
[00:44] question
[00:45] who was the best at his best we started
[00:48] the aba merger and go through the best
[00:50] multi-year stretches examining the
[00:52] legends who provided the most
[00:54] on court impact these are the greatest
[00:58] peaks
[01:05] to me we hit you in phrases got you
[01:08] almost
[01:11] this is the worst right here nice try
[01:15] duncan is easily the best modern
[01:17] defender never to win defensive player
[01:19] of the year
[01:20] his teammate bruce bowen is actually the
[01:23] only player with a larger share of votes
[01:25] over the years to never claim the award
[01:28] and like great defensive centers before
[01:30] him tim's value comes from protecting
[01:32] the most important real estate in the
[01:34] game
[01:35] the space right in front of the hoop
[01:37] i've never seen any public record of his
[01:39] actual wingspan
[01:41] but duncan was long he was around seven
[01:44] feet without shoes and had the arms of a
[01:46] weeping willow tree
[01:49] this is one of the reasons he blocked so
[01:50] many shots out of a shooter's
[01:52] hand he had great feel and timing when
[01:56] targeting attempts like this kenyon
[01:58] martin is auditioning for the role of
[02:00] charles smith here
[02:02] until kevin willis ruins it with a foul
[02:05] and here devin george is overcome with
[02:08] the wild
[02:08] idea to baptize duncan and notice timmy
[02:11] use that off arm again to slow down
[02:13] george and feel out the block
[02:15] timmy this time it's rob ory trying him
[02:19] and duncan takes a big step and again
[02:21] uses his off arm to brace
[02:23] against him and that swimmer's reach can
[02:25] do the rest
[02:27] his strength helps this style of shot
[02:29] contesting
[02:30] because he doesn't need to load up to
[02:32] jump he plows through his man here and
[02:34] probably catches kobe by surprise
[02:37] and the big fundamental likely caught
[02:39] plenty of shooters off guard because he
[02:42] kept his hands
[02:43] down when he moved then typically
[02:45] brought them up when jumping like this
[02:47] so he was always under control when
[02:49] sliding over to help in the paint
[02:52] this steady body control allowed him to
[02:55] challenge threats in the lane
[02:56] and then immediately recover into a
[02:58] second challenge
[03:00] which is one of the perks of a more
[03:02] floor-bound approach because he never
[03:04] jumped himself
[03:05] out of a play again you'll see his hands
[03:09] are down
[03:10] ready to jump but he stays locked and
[03:12] loaded and his windmill arms meant he
[03:14] could swivel from one threat to the next
[03:16] because his rim protection was less
[03:18] about leaping and more about
[03:20] timing and that ant like standing reach
[03:24] duncan's block percentage during the
[03:26] playoffs in these seasons
[03:27] wasn't too far from the all-time greats
[03:30] although his numbers were suppressed
[03:31] slightly by playing next to another
[03:33] center when the spurs went to win towers
[03:36] there was about a 15
[03:37] reduction in his block rate of course
[03:40] keeping his hands down and not
[03:42] out meant he rarely deflected passes and
[03:45] that made it a touch
[03:46] easier to slip them around him another
[03:49] key to duncan's paint defense was his
[03:51] positioning
[03:52] he'd sag into the lane an extra step or
[03:54] two so he didn't have to go far to meet
[03:56] penetrators
[03:57] again note the body control to stay down
[04:00] and he barely needs to jump to swat
[04:02] it he could stand one step into the lane
[04:06] using the classic
[04:07] toe tapping technique to avoid three
[04:08] seconds and that cut down the distance
[04:10] to help
[04:11] off the weak side here he slaps his hips
[04:14] in disagreement
[04:15] a rare move in a deep bag of
[04:18] protestations
[04:19] some of which were more animated and
[04:22] some of which were more
[04:23] subtle performance art although my
[04:25] personal favorite is the incredulous
[04:27] stare
[04:29] i'll bet your money on that one i don't
[04:31] bet anything i'll go for a hamburger
[04:34] you got it speaking of reactions
[04:37] duncan's weren't always
[04:38] lightning quick george is free here
[04:41] before he goes
[04:42] but he's so well positioned it takes one
[04:44] step to protect the rim
[04:45] and there was usually a tiny delay
[04:47] before he started sliding
[04:49] and the third time was not the charm for
[04:51] devin
[04:53] td usually arrived on time but sometimes
[04:56] that minor delay and reaction speed
[04:58] led to a bucket but he also didn't need
[05:00] nanosecond processing because he was
[05:02] such a big
[05:03] presence any quick step toward the ball
[05:05] handler heavily influenced drives
[05:08] he was even long enough to throw off
[05:09] floaters from skilled guards
[05:12] in general duncan was aware of most
[05:15] threats
[05:16] after some creative screening he slides
[05:18] toward the action here
[05:20] then realizes he needs to help on the
[05:22] roll man and that is a
[05:23] tough make here's another storm of ball
[05:26] screens by the offense
[05:28] and he plugs up the first roller
[05:30] realizes he needs to recover to the
[05:32] second screen
[05:33] and smothers the ball handler in a great
[05:35] team
[05:36] sequence duncan was part of a unit that
[05:39] choked off opponents at the rim holding
[05:42] them
[05:43] well below league average on these high
[05:44] value attempts
[05:46] the spurs were most successful with two
[05:48] centers out there
[05:49] but even with duncan as the lone
[05:51] middleman they defended the paint
[05:53] incredibly well
[05:54] and in general thrived behind a
[05:56] defensively oriented roster
[05:59] this is also where greg popovich
[06:01] established himself as an
[06:02] all-time coach throwing in a zone every
[06:04] once in a while to throw
[06:06] off opponents and instilling air-tight
[06:08] schemes
[06:09] the spurs switch this pick and roll
[06:11] because amari stodomier is mismatched
[06:13] with a wing
[06:14] then duncan can pick up amari behind the
[06:16] play and manu ginobili is down in a
[06:19] driving gap and the whole thing's a
[06:20] clinic
[06:22] the consistent implementation of these
[06:24] principles was impressive
[06:26] a big shows on the pick and roll here
[06:28] which means the other big in the paint
[06:30] slides to cover the roller
[06:31] and wings were always prioritizing paint
[06:34] help bruce bowen is sealing inside
[06:36] duncan's man
[06:37] and then the rotations quickly follow
[06:39] and it leads to a low percentage
[06:41] shot with ginobili and tony parker yet
[06:45] to enter their primes
[06:46] that spurs roster was lighter on
[06:48] offensive parts
[06:49] and instead featured defensive studs
[06:51] like bowen and an aging admiral
[06:54] who had his moments in spurts all of
[06:57] this made the spurs a defensive dynasty
[07:00] posting some of the best multi-year
[07:02] stretches of regular season
[07:03] and playoff defense in league history
[07:07] san antonio's defense was practically
[07:09] elite without duncan
[07:11] holding teams nearly four points below
[07:13] league average from 2001 to 2004
[07:16] with him on the bench with duncan
[07:19] protecting the paint
[07:20] as an anchor the spurs became an
[07:22] all-time
[07:23] defense and he had the ability to plug
[07:26] up breakdowns with fantastic
[07:28] saves like this however he did have some
[07:32] blind spots in his vision
[07:34] meaning he couldn't always locate the
[07:35] ball instantly or anticipate danger at
[07:38] all times
[07:39] he just completely misses this slip play
[07:41] that utah like to bust out on occasion
[07:44] and he could have a little tunnel vision
[07:46] while on the move this cut isn't really
[07:49] going anywhere
[07:49] but he zones out and misses the back
[07:51] door
[07:53] and this is almost identical to a play
[07:55] from last episode
[07:56] where robinson helps in front of duncan
[07:59] only tim
[08:00] doesn't slide over to cover robinson's
[08:02] man until it's too late
[08:03] and there's no heroic save duncan played
[08:06] these spurs pick and roll scheme
[08:08] reasonably well showing then recovering
[08:11] to his man
[08:12] but he was particularly effective
[08:14] sagging off the dribbler and then using
[08:16] his length to bother pull-up jumpers
[08:19] even far out on the perimeter his
[08:21] never-ending arms caught shooters off
[08:23] guard
[08:24] and since he was mobile enough to
[08:26] venture out a bit and use
[08:27] that size to keep ball handlers at bay
[08:30] he was well suited for sagging dropping
[08:33] coverages against pick and rolls
[08:36] his lateral movement wasn't really a
[08:38] strength
[08:39] and he was slightly vulnerable on the
[08:41] outside to quickness
[08:43] on this play he's supposed to slow down
[08:44] the ball but the sharp change of
[08:46] direction leaves him in kobe's wake
[08:48] and that whole twin towers thing was so
[08:51] effective back then
[08:53] now while duncan's mobility wasn't great
[08:56] he was slow to decelerate for instance
[08:58] he wasn't a liability moving around the
[09:00] floor during that era
[09:02] while he could be beaten by quicker
[09:04] players when guarding the ball
[09:06] it was rare for big man at the time to
[09:08] face up on the perimeter
[09:10] and attack him with speed off the bounce
[09:13] if anything
[09:14] the slower more interior based game
[09:17] amplified some of td's man defense
[09:19] where his length could really bother
[09:21] opponents who couldn't stretch him to
[09:23] the outside
[09:25] he was also really strong strong enough
[09:28] not to be completely manhandled by shaq
[09:30] himself
[09:31] of course that didn't work every
[09:33] possession i'm convinced flopping was
[09:35] the only way to
[09:36] actually slow down o'neill so
[09:39] just like we've seen from most of the
[09:41] big men in this series
[09:42] duncan's defense was an enormous value
[09:45] add
[09:46] the bigger question though is just how
[09:48] valuable was an offense
[09:50] run through tim duncan
[09:55] tim duncan your town the week of
[09:58] greatness is back at foot locker
[09:59] no way that's insane
[10:02] i'm
[10:09] in contrast to the guard-like approach
[10:11] we saw last episode from kevin garnett
[10:14] duncan's offensive game was rooted deep
[10:16] in the paint like a traditional
[10:18] center unlike old school centers he was
[10:21] skilled enough to attack from the
[10:22] perimeter
[10:23] he could face and drive all the way to
[10:25] the hole but wherever he started
[10:27] duncan was often grinding closer to the
[10:29] basket with his strength
[10:32] because he was a contemporary of shaq
[10:34] few people talked about just how strong
[10:36] timmy was but he often worked for deeper
[10:39] position
[10:40] and powered into his points at 260
[10:44] pounds
[10:44] he could hold this low position on the
[10:46] block and then
[10:47] swim into a move with force notice how
[10:50] he dislodges his defender with his
[10:52] shoulder
[10:53] to create space for the shot and he
[10:56] would lead with his
[10:57] arms on these little half hooks and
[10:59] turning push shots
[11:00] watch closely he swivels into ori and
[11:04] throws his arm straight up through ori's
[11:07] left arm
[11:07] into the release this takes great hand
[11:11] strength and turns his off arm into a
[11:13] shield again
[11:14] backing down closer and even though his
[11:16] man is sitting on the shot
[11:17] he flares that left elbow for protection
[11:21] all of these deliberate churning moves
[11:23] require incredible balance and
[11:25] sturdiness
[11:26] he sort of pushes the defender with the
[11:28] ball before going through him
[11:30] which takes a velcro grip and
[11:33] this technique naturally led to the rip
[11:35] through foul where
[11:36] duncan picked up a bunch of extra free
[11:38] throws any time his opponent's arms were
[11:41] down or when they reached for an exposed
[11:43] ball
[11:44] and missed free throws were a big part
[11:47] of duncan's scoring prowess
[11:49] his three-year peak and free-throw
[11:50] attempts falls in the 98th percentile
[11:53] historically
[11:54] and unlike shaq that served as an
[11:56] efficiency booster
[11:57] since duncan shot 70 from the line
[12:01] so much of his scoring was about
[12:03] methodically inching closer to the rim
[12:06] occasionally he'd try that up and under
[12:08] and sometimes he throw in this power
[12:10] spin move where he's squeezing the ball
[12:12] in a vice
[12:14] you'll notice he was rarely off balance
[12:16] so when he spins away from the double
[12:18] team
[12:18] all his weight is over that right leg
[12:20] which helps him finish through
[12:22] contact when his avenues to the hoop
[12:25] were cut off
[12:26] he liked a little turnaround over his
[12:28] left shoulder
[12:29] and like so many great post scores he
[12:32] could also wheel into the same turn
[12:33] around over his
[12:34] other shoulder although unlike many
[12:37] right-handed players
[12:39] it was rarer to see him turn off this
[12:41] shoulder
[12:42] there's a rip-through attempt again and
[12:44] i wonder if he was more comfortable
[12:46] shooting these turning left because he
[12:48] could use that off arm to clear out a
[12:50] contesting hand
[12:54] of course because it was a tim duncan
[12:56] move he would jab step and fake his way
[12:58] into a little kiss
[12:59] off the glass every once in a while now
[13:03] where have i seen that before duncan's
[13:06] bank shot wasn't actually a huge part of
[13:09] his game
[13:10] he called on it whenever he was facing
[13:12] the basket at an angle like this
[13:14] but the banker was merely a component of
[13:16] his larger face up attack
[13:18] which involved little pull-ups on the
[13:20] baseline or in the middle of the floor
[13:22] even duncan wasn't actually a strong
[13:25] outside shooter
[13:26] making about 38 of his shots beyond 15
[13:29] feet during these seasons which landed
[13:32] him in the bottom third of the league at
[13:33] the time
[13:35] i don't know how much more accurate he
[13:36] was going to the bank on these attempts
[13:39] he was certainly comfortable jab
[13:41] stepping and then playing it off the
[13:42] window
[13:43] but this was still a flat stroke with a
[13:45] hitch
[13:47] some of these were straight out of the
[13:48] adrian dantly school of
[13:50] rhythmic up faking
[13:53] the shot was threatening enough to open
[13:55] up driving lanes
[13:56] where he could pump fake repeatedly
[13:58] until a defender reacted and then head
[14:00] downhill
[14:01] there's that strength and body control
[14:03] to take contact from shaq
[14:05] while decelerating despite his shooting
[14:08] struggles
[14:09] duncan actually had some nice touch on
[14:11] these slow-motion rumbles to the rim
[14:14] he wasn't the quickest but he was always
[14:16] under control and dexterous enough to
[14:18] flip in
[14:18] all kinds of little shots his face of
[14:21] game was aided by a tight handle
[14:24] that let him put his head down and go
[14:27] he didn't have the change of direction
[14:28] to unlock a variety of dribble moves
[14:31] but he was secure enough to barrel
[14:32] through players on drives like this
[14:35] we saw a svelter kevin garnett struggle
[14:37] to hold that line last
[14:39] episode all of duncan's high percentage
[14:42] shot attempts and free throws
[14:44] made him a strong playoff scorer during
[14:47] these seasons
[14:48] stacking up well against most big men
[14:50] historically
[14:51] save for the best of the very best using
[14:54] these playoff numbers
[14:55] he looks far closer to elijahuan than to
[14:58] someone like walton
[14:59] as a scoring hub but there's a little
[15:02] more to the story
[15:03] when duncan faced stronger defenses his
[15:05] scoring wasn't quite as
[15:07] potent dropping off more than many of
[15:09] the modern greats
[15:11] and he had similar struggles in the
[15:12] postseason he just didn't
[15:14] play many elite defenses in part because
[15:17] the spurs were so good
[15:19] by the way like hakeem duncan took up
[15:22] basketball later than most
[15:24] he was a 13 year old swimmer in the
[15:26] virgin islands when he started
[15:28] and because of that late start he said
[15:30] he didn't feel he was ready for the nba
[15:32] after his junior year at wake forest
[15:35] when he would have been the number one
[15:37] pick in the draft
[15:39] this lack of experience might have been
[15:41] a reason why he started with some fuzzy
[15:43] court vision
[15:44] but he was always an eager student and
[15:46] willing passer
[15:47] and in time he figured out what to look
[15:49] for as an offensive
[15:51] hub he learned passing reads that
[15:53] allowed the spurs to stream a ton of
[15:55] their offense
[15:56] through him they could dump it to timmy
[15:59] in the post
[16:00] and have him attack help by kicking it
[16:02] to a three-point shooter
[16:04] or he could wait for the double and find
[16:06] a teammate
[16:07] cutting this should look familiar
[16:10] it's the same kind of inside out offense
[16:12] that we saw with olajuwon's rockets
[16:14] and o'neill's lakers on this one he
[16:18] patiently allows the defense to commit
[16:19] near the baseline
[16:21] so the basic kick out is open and man
[16:23] ginobili made some
[16:25] big plays in 2003 this is the exact same
[16:29] set we just saw
[16:30] only the help comes off the cutter to
[16:32] the corner so duncan fires it there
[16:34] nicely for a wide open
[16:36] look and his towering height
[16:39] helped him move through these
[16:41] progressions with high
[16:42] quick releases when he spotted an open
[16:45] cutter
[16:46] he even flashed another walton move the
[16:49] little jump
[16:50] pass in tight quarters creating an even
[16:52] better angle for an express shipment
[16:55] his best most consistent passes were
[16:58] probably these structured reads from the
[17:00] post to cutters or
[17:01] shooters and estimates of shock creation
[17:03] peg him slightly behind someone like
[17:05] kevin garnett
[17:07] velocity helped the big fundamental
[17:10] because he didn't really throw to
[17:11] openings before they emerged
[17:13] that could have been a touch earlier and
[17:16] sometimes that made a difference
[17:18] a key to hitting tight windows is to
[17:20] anticipate movement
[17:21] and here there's a lag and he's not
[17:23] ready to snap it over and by then it's
[17:25] too
[17:25] late when he could see a pass in front
[17:28] of him
[17:29] he could drop some lovely dimes
[17:31] robinson's in his line of sight here
[17:33] and those huge hands make the magic
[17:35] happen
[17:37] speaking of magic he was a favorite of
[17:39] duncan's growing up
[17:40] and so timmy always wanted to freestyle
[17:43] like a guard
[17:44] in transition and there's a johnson
[17:46] inspired look away
[17:48] he still had blind spots at his peak
[17:51] openings and his periphery could go
[17:53] unnoticed here's another one where the
[17:56] cut starts out of the corner of his eye
[17:58] but he's kind of locked into his bank
[18:00] shot dance
[18:01] sometimes it felt like once he committed
[18:03] to a movement there was no going back
[18:06] he starts throwing this pass without
[18:07] adjusting for the defender
[18:09] even though his teammate did and i think
[18:11] duncan had more of these
[18:12] glitchy looking turnovers than most
[18:15] superstars
[18:17] however slow adjustments don't mean slow
[18:20] actions and he could certainly map the
[18:22] floor in front of him when he had a
[18:24] second to process it
[18:25] and then move the ball quickly to my eye
[18:29] he was most comfortable with quick reads
[18:31] out of set pieces
[18:32] where he knew what to look for like in a
[18:35] short roll situation with a teammate in
[18:37] the dunker spot
[18:39] he had nice chemistry with robinson in
[18:42] particular
[18:43] especially on passes from the top there
[18:45] was a kind of
[18:47] big to big simpatico with these lobs to
[18:49] the admiral
[18:51] and they even ran a little twin tower
[18:53] pick and roll with the courts based
[18:55] unfortunately those were very rare but
[18:58] it wasn't rare for duncan to hop along
[19:00] with his front court mate
[19:02] synchronized swimming style finally
[19:05] the big fundamental could snap off some
[19:07] brisk
[19:08] outlets and he would even try to throw
[19:10] these over the top when the opportunity
[19:12] presented itself
[19:13] which was a nice fit with smaller
[19:15] players who like to get out and run in
[19:17] transition
[19:19] much like walton's blazers san antonio's
[19:22] duncan-centric
[19:23] attacks produced pretty good results but
[19:26] they certainly weren't a team
[19:28] powered by offense finishing about two
[19:30] points ahead of the league on that end
[19:32] from 2001 to 2003.
[19:35] ironically the o3 title team was one of
[19:37] the weakest spurs teams
[19:38] of duncan's prime but a theme of this
[19:42] series
[19:42] is the difference between building an
[19:44] offense around a big man
[19:46] versus a team around a big man like
[19:49] walton
[19:50] garnett and robinson duncan's two-way
[19:52] impact made him a
[19:54] superstar and on those teams his post-op
[19:57] game was a perfect fit for a defensively
[20:00] slanted roster
[20:01] that was supercharged by duncan's paint
[20:03] protection
[20:04] because of this he has some legendary
[20:07] plus minus stats during these seasons
[20:10] posting the second largest point
[20:11] differential on record when he was on
[20:13] the court
[20:14] compared to when he was off the court
[20:16] trailing only his teammate david
[20:18] robinson from the preceding three years
[20:21] while robinson and duncan reinforce the
[20:23] incredible value of defensive studs
[20:26] who are offensive all-stars it gives me
[20:29] some pause that the top two numbers came
[20:32] from the same team in back to back
[20:34] periods there's plenty of noise in 50
[20:36] games of plus minus data
[20:38] and duncan's surrounding stretches do
[20:40] look drastically different
[20:43] there were nagging injuries in those
[20:44] following years but his scoring numbers
[20:47] remain the same
[20:49] part of the plus-minus drop-off was
[20:51] probably san antonio growing less
[20:53] dependent on his offense
[20:54] as players like parker and ginobili
[20:56] emerged
[20:58] the spurs became a very good playoff
[21:01] offense in the mid 2000s
[21:03] and while duncan certainly wasn't a poor
[21:05] fit
[21:06] his brand of slower high viscosity post
[21:09] scoring
[21:10] doesn't scale up that well methodical
[21:13] isolation scoring
[21:14] can lift a team's offensive floor but
[21:17] it's hard to be a
[21:18] great co-pilot with that approach
[21:21] his lack of outside shooting limited
[21:24] some of his off-ball value
[21:25] he could splash in jumpers off a pick
[21:28] and pop
[21:28] but he just wasn't that efficient on
[21:31] these
[21:32] he was a far better role man where he
[21:34] could catch and finish through contact
[21:36] near the rim
[21:37] and he was mobile enough to take a
[21:39] dribble and adjust
[21:40] at the hoop and this kind of off-ball
[21:43] game
[21:44] is a key to blending in on better and
[21:46] better offenses
[21:48] he added more value with his offensive
[21:50] rebounding game
[21:51] although they were often grabbing his
[21:53] own misses which was also a byproduct of
[21:56] his
[21:56] power scoring constantly trying to press
[22:00] forward toward the basket this is kind
[22:02] of like a lighter version of what we saw
[22:04] from shaq
[22:05] in episode 9. you can also see how
[22:08] crazy long duncan is here barely jumping
[22:11] to
[22:12] reach 10 feet this overall combination
[22:15] of
[22:15] scoring shot blocking and plus minus
[22:18] data
[22:19] gave peak duncan some of the best impact
[22:21] metrics on record
[22:23] and while they might overstate his value
[22:25] they also drive home how valuable his
[22:28] archetype can be where duncan's low post
[22:31] scoring and playmaking
[22:33] can help weaker offenses reach
[22:35] respectable heights
[22:36] while at the same time driving them to
[22:38] contention with
[22:40] huge impact on defense and that same
[22:43] package can turn a solid team into a
[22:46] title favorite
[22:47] which is exactly why tim duncan's
[22:49] two-way impact
[22:51] gave him one of history's greatest
[22:54] peaks for more historical content and to

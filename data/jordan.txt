[00:00] you know michael jordan you know his
[00:03] legendary moments
[00:05] you know that fadeaway you know his
[00:07] aerial gifts
[00:09] but do you know what made him unique as
[00:11] a scorer
[00:12] the ins and outs of his passing game his
[00:16] defensive strengths
[00:17] and weaknesses jordan's mystique grew in
[00:20] the 90s but
[00:22] did he actually reach his peak before he
[00:24] ever hoisted a championship
[00:26] trophy and were those the best seasons
[00:28] that we've ever seen
[00:30] on a basketball court you are
[00:33] watching what greatness is all about
[00:36] where's larry bird in all this has it
[00:39] blocked by elijah
[00:41] michael jordan saves the this series
[00:44] tackles
[00:45] one question who was the best at his
[00:48] best
[00:49] we start at the aba merger and go
[00:50] through the best multi-year stretches
[00:52] examining the legends who provided the
[00:54] most on-court impact
[00:57] these are the greatest peaks
[01:05] he's the best athlete he's one of the
[01:07] best competitors he's one of the most
[01:08] skilled players
[01:09] and that to me makes him the best
[01:11] basketball player
[01:12] that i've ever seen play in this series
[01:15] we've seen how big men
[01:16] ruled the game for decades and how the
[01:18] offensive brilliance of magic
[01:20] johnson and larry bird reimagined what
[01:23] taller players could do
[01:25] but there were high flying wings with
[01:27] offensive success in the 60s and 70s too
[01:30] elgin baylor was the first superstar who
[01:32] really attacked
[01:33] vertically off the bounce then julius
[01:35] irving and david thompson
[01:37] extended that approach as a kid growing
[01:40] up in north carolina
[01:41] jordan idolized thompson who combined an
[01:44] explosive first step with a little
[01:46] sky walking to finish third in mvp
[01:49] voting
[01:49] in 1978. jordan was the next leap in
[01:53] that evolutionary chain
[01:55] and his incredible first step set a new
[01:58] standard for attacking the rim
[02:01] when he entered the league michael could
[02:02] just teleport around defenders with his
[02:05] burst
[02:06] able to get around players in just a
[02:08] single step
[02:10] and even though he was a hair slower by
[02:12] 1989
[02:13] this incredible acceleration was always
[02:15] the foundation of jordan's success
[02:18] he'd burn defenders to the right or to
[02:20] the left with this penetration
[02:22] and he was so quick that blinking was
[02:24] dangerous joe dumars flinches at a
[02:26] turnaround here
[02:27] and then becomes a turnstile there
[02:30] wasn't anything special about this being
[02:32] a
[02:32] first step it was just mind-bending
[02:35] acceleration
[02:36] jordan's like a formula one car racing
[02:38] against
[02:39] priuses that acceleration shot him out
[02:41] of a cannon
[02:42] and that speed was a launch pad for his
[02:44] vertical finishing
[02:46] he's flying by the second step here and
[02:48] that helps him actually
[02:50] fly really the man spent so much time in
[02:53] the air he could have registered a tail
[02:54] number with the faa
[02:57] some of these drives remind me of a
[02:59] running back turning the corner
[03:00] where he'd take off and get really low
[03:03] then transfer all that energy into his
[03:05] leaping
[03:06] note how his body protects the ball here
[03:08] as he hovers to the other side of the
[03:10] rim
[03:11] and he leveraged his body as an airborne
[03:14] shield like this
[03:15] especially when jumping off of two feet
[03:17] into contact
[03:18] michael was strong enough to absorb hits
[03:21] while airborne like this
[03:22] and these physical gifts helped him
[03:24] reach the line at historically prolific
[03:27] rates magic kept defenses off balance
[03:31] with his playmaking
[03:32] but michael simply overwhelmed them with
[03:34] relentless pressure on the rim
[03:37] his huge hands helped make some of this
[03:39] aerial wizardry possible
[03:41] manipulating the ball in the air on
[03:42] these drives or holding it away from
[03:45] shot blockers that's near the top of the
[03:47] square
[03:48] on the release and these things were so
[03:50] big that the ball could slip off
[03:52] mid-shot
[03:53] and he could still reset it in his
[03:54] catcher's mitts like nothing happened
[03:57] of course the hang time also makes this
[04:00] work too
[04:01] contorting and bending his body around
[04:04] bigger defenders in the paint
[04:06] jordan displayed the most fluid body
[04:09] control of perhaps
[04:10] any player ever slithering around
[04:12] opponents as he floated into a clear
[04:14] shot attempt
[04:16] and we haven't even mentioned his
[04:17] footwork which was balletic at times
[04:20] allowing him to keep his balance while
[04:22] pivoting around like a top
[04:24] and then that hanging aerial control to
[04:27] still square
[04:28] his shoulders on the shot his legs were
[04:30] kicked out on the foul here
[04:32] and it didn't matter all that hovering
[04:35] and twisting helped michael's mid-range
[04:37] game
[04:37] too his typical pull-ups were
[04:40] supercharged with that elevation
[04:42] hitting a trampoline and then firing
[04:44] over defenders
[04:45] and whether he was twisting leaning or
[04:48] stopping on a dime
[04:49] he could square his shoulders and still
[04:51] shoot and this
[04:53] kinesthetic mastery made his famous
[04:55] dagger against cleveland in 1989
[04:58] possible where he pumps and hangs but
[05:01] right there squares himself comfortably
[05:04] and
[05:04] strokes it incredible we shouldn't
[05:08] overlook his shooting from the mid-range
[05:10] either he was an 85 free throw shooter
[05:13] during these years
[05:14] and was a knock down shooter inside 20
[05:17] feet
[05:18] when given space but he also created
[05:21] space vertically with that leaping
[05:23] ability
[05:24] changing directions and springing clear
[05:26] for a good look
[05:30] michael didn't make thousands of jumpers
[05:32] with a hand in his face
[05:33] he made thousands by jumping so high his
[05:36] releases were rarely ever
[05:38] bothered as you've probably noticed his
[05:41] handle was good enough to support
[05:42] sharp cuts and he really liked this low
[05:45] in and out dribble to set up defenders
[05:47] and probe for open space he wasn't an
[05:50] incredible ball
[05:52] handler but he was good enough to knife
[05:54] around the court
[05:55] and since he could also score at the
[05:57] basket with either hand
[05:59] jordan's robust repertoire made him the
[06:01] greatest scorer
[06:02] in nba history if we look at three-year
[06:06] playoff stretches and adjust for
[06:07] inflation to 2020 scoring rates
[06:09] jordan scored an astounding 34 points
[06:12] every 75 possessions
[06:14] on true shooting 7 better than average
[06:17] from 1989 to 1991. he holds the
[06:21] top nine stretches in postseason scoring
[06:24] rate
[06:24] peaking in the late 80s and early 90s
[06:27] when his explosiveness was still intact
[06:30] and his mid-range accuracy was dialed in
[06:33] he could always fall back on his most
[06:35] iconic move to fade away
[06:37] you see what i did there sometimes mj
[06:39] would get right into this off the catch
[06:42] and that hang time and separation
[06:44] created really clean releases
[06:46] he preferred going to his right hand on
[06:48] this move until about 1990 or 1991
[06:51] when that vintage fade to the other side
[06:54] started popping up more
[06:55] regularly i recommend j kyle mann's
[06:58] history of the fadeaway
[06:59] for more on this shot since the triangle
[07:03] offense organically generated post-ups
[07:06] phil jackson's arrival in 1991
[07:08] facilitated
[07:09] more fadeaways for jordan here's a great
[07:12] counter cut
[07:13] audibling off this route with the
[07:15] defender overplaying him
[07:17] and flashing right back to the low block
[07:19] for the catch and turn
[07:21] michael's agility helped him off ball
[07:24] too
[07:24] using screens and setting up opponents
[07:27] for sharp changes in direction
[07:29] that freed him up so much of chicago's
[07:32] offense before phil jackson
[07:34] was bringing jordan off picks from the
[07:36] baseline
[07:37] and since he was comfortable flowing
[07:39] into attacks like this since his college
[07:41] days
[07:41] the activity and principles of the
[07:43] triangle helped harness his off-ball
[07:46] movement
[07:47] the triangle offense prioritizes
[07:49] balancing the floor
[07:50] and ball movement principles that played
[07:52] right into jordan's strengths as a
[07:54] catch-and-go
[07:55] scorer while michael could read screens
[07:58] and then flash to open areas well
[08:00] he could also punish ball denial with
[08:02] that quick change of direction
[08:04] and with increased space he was so hard
[08:07] to contain
[08:09] these back cuts were organic feeling an
[08:12] overplay then darting free to the bucket
[08:15] and his movement meant defenses always
[08:18] had to worry about him
[08:19] he cuts right out of traps like this
[08:21] instead of idling
[08:22] and even when a teammate misses him
[08:24] those cuts could lead to rebounds
[08:26] all his activity and his athleticism
[08:29] made him an excellent offensive
[08:30] rebounder
[08:31] which is often overlooked because he was
[08:33] usually doing the shooting
[08:35] but this added additional off-ball value
[08:37] to his game
[08:39] on the other hand his weakness as an off
[08:41] ball player was his three point shooting
[08:43] where he peaked at 34 percent on low
[08:46] volume
[08:47] it didn't seem to matter if these were
[08:48] pull ups or catch and shoot chances
[08:51] but i do think jordan's release at the
[08:53] apex of his huge
[08:54] jump limited his range to a degree
[08:58] when the nba shortened the line to 22
[09:00] feet in 1995
[09:01] mike made 38 on over 750 attempts
[09:05] before struggling again when the line
[09:07] returned to 24
[09:08] feet otherwise jordan was such a dynamic
[09:12] scorer
[09:13] that he flummoxed almost any defense of
[09:15] the time
[09:16] the bad boy's pistons dented him
[09:18] slightly but that's about
[09:20] it and yet despite his otherworldly
[09:22] scoring gifts
[09:23] he wouldn't have six championships
[09:26] without a huge part of his game
[09:28] that is often overlooked
[09:31] [Music]
[09:33] rumors michael jordan is retired
[09:38] faked his own retirement i don't know i
[09:40] know he loves basketball he's probably
[09:42] playing in his backyard with his kids
[09:43] but i don't think he faked his
[09:44] retirement when michael was younger he
[09:46] was often criticized for
[09:48] shooting into double teams frequently
[09:50] and while his athleticism was
[09:51] breathtaking
[09:52] his shot selection was questionable at
[09:55] times some of these were really
[09:56] difficult attempts
[09:58] he was so skilled that it's hard to say
[10:00] he took poor shots per se
[10:02] but mj was frequently doubled or tripled
[10:05] and bypassed wide open teammates
[10:08] for some of these attempts given his
[10:10] high volume
[10:11] shooting there are few players in nba
[10:14] history
[10:14] who shot into extra coverage while a
[10:16] teammate was open
[10:18] more than michael jordan now without
[10:21] strong
[10:22] three-point shooting teammates back then
[10:24] missing these spot-up shooters probably
[10:26] didn't hurt
[10:27] that much and more importantly these
[10:30] missed passes were easily outweighed by
[10:32] all of the open shots michael did set up
[10:35] his constant penetration collapsed
[10:37] defenses into the lane
[10:39] and when he did opt to pass chicago
[10:42] ended up with wide open looks
[10:44] that last play was a jump pass and
[10:46] jordan often went
[10:47] airborne for a shot before checking down
[10:50] to an open shooter like this
[10:52] that luigi hang time helped him to react
[10:55] to defensive decisions
[10:57] before finally passing the mic to a band
[11:00] mate
[11:00] these jump passes set up more than just
[11:03] outside shots
[11:04] jordan preferred to hit teammates in the
[11:06] lane
[11:07] and his go-to playmaking move was
[11:09] drawing a defender away from the rim
[11:11] as he hovered then throwing one right to
[11:14] that vacated spot
[11:16] mike loved this jump and dumped laydown
[11:19] where he drove to the basket
[11:20] and then with the big man stepped up to
[11:22] help found a way to drop it off for a
[11:24] layup
[11:26] these were some of his best passes and
[11:28] he really dialed them in during the 1991
[11:30] playoffs
[11:31] when he anticipated these little
[11:32] openings more and used his parasailing
[11:35] ability to exploit them more
[11:37] consistently
[11:38] however leaving his feet like this
[11:41] caused some
[11:42] issues when he decided not to shoot
[11:44] holding a hot potato while hovering with
[11:46] no clear
[11:47] outlet when he was in the air like this
[11:49] he was at the mercy of whatever was
[11:52] open he switches to a pass here but
[11:54] there's nothing really
[11:55] there and another problem with passing
[11:57] like this
[11:58] is avoiding all the contesting arms and
[12:00] hands
[12:01] so many of these balls were deflected
[12:03] and as a result his reactionary jump
[12:06] passes
[12:06] led to a number of his turnovers jordan
[12:09] rarely anticipated openings as a passer
[12:13] this is a simple lead pass to the
[12:14] streaking horus grant
[12:16] but he had to throw it early and he sees
[12:18] it late and then he thinks better of it
[12:21] here he doesn't realize this teammate is
[12:23] uncovered
[12:24] and so it's a dubious jumper instead of
[12:26] a layup pass
[12:28] on this one scottie pippen's back door
[12:31] cut opens a lob
[12:32] but jordan sees it after it's free
[12:35] then fires it and man could pip and pass
[12:39] most of michael's best dimes were more
[12:41] reactive
[12:42] seeing an opening and then whipping it
[12:44] to a teammate
[12:46] despite his reputation he was always a
[12:48] willing passer
[12:49] and learning more angles and reads over
[12:51] the years helped him drop
[12:52] higher level dimes like this he threw in
[12:55] a bit of manipulation beyond that jump
[12:58] pass
[12:58] going to the lookaway at times and this
[13:00] is his peak passing in 1991
[13:03] moving the defender with his eyes then
[13:05] impersonating magic
[13:07] in front of ervin himself
[13:10] jordan was also willing to look ahead
[13:12] for outlet passes
[13:13] this is one of his better ones and he
[13:15] was a good transition passer
[13:17] dropping a brilliant dime on the break
[13:19] every once in a while
[13:21] too to be fair he missed plenty of good
[13:24] passes in these spots as well
[13:26] pippin's clear here and flying into the
[13:29] lane that familiar drop off
[13:30] is open in studying pastors over the
[13:34] years
[13:34] the great ones will find about 90 of
[13:37] these open looks
[13:38] whereas michael connected on them about
[13:40] 66 percent of the time
[13:42] but keep in mind the sheer volume of
[13:44] open chances he carved out
[13:46] by drawing attention away from his
[13:48] teammates with his perpetual scoring
[13:50] pressure
[13:51] in the playoffs there are no more than
[13:54] five players in nba history
[13:56] who created more shots for teammates
[13:58] than jordan
[13:59] and if we use the same playmaking
[14:01] estimates from the prior episode
[14:03] michael set up his teammates for an open
[14:05] look and estimated
[14:06] 14 times every 100 possessions
[14:10] a stretch only bested by the game's top
[14:12] offensive engines
[14:13] from the last 15 years and so while
[14:16] jordan was revered for winning 10
[14:19] scoring titles
[14:20] he was one of the all-time playmaking
[14:23] machines
[14:23] in league history that raised a weak
[14:27] roster and carried a strong one later on
[14:30] from 1985 to 1989 before scottie pippen
[14:33] emerged and the triangle took hold
[14:35] the bulls offensive efficiency was only
[14:37] around league
[14:38] average there was only so much michael
[14:40] could do as the lone offensive force
[14:43] on a defensively constructed roster
[14:45] pippin's emergence gave the bulls
[14:47] another elite finisher and secondary
[14:49] scoring weapon
[14:50] but more importantly another playmaker
[14:53] scotty's passing is historically under
[14:56] discussed
[14:56] and he was a deadly grab-and-go player
[14:59] either finding layups in transition
[15:01] or doing the damage himself as he came
[15:04] down the lane
[15:06] pip was also one of the all-time great
[15:08] wing defenders
[15:09] and that along with his unselfishness
[15:11] made him a
[15:12] near perfect complimentary piece next to
[15:15] michael
[15:16] jordan himself improved as a passer at
[15:18] the end of the 80s and into the 90s
[15:20] and with better teammates the bulls
[15:22] roared to some of the best offensive
[15:24] seasons
[15:24] on record right behind magic's lakers
[15:27] and while we think of magic
[15:29] as having everything run through him on
[15:31] offense
[15:32] michael's combination of scoring and
[15:34] playmaking
[15:35] gave him one of the highest offensive
[15:37] loads in playoff history
[15:40] while jordan's passing highs were mixed
[15:43] with some blemishes
[15:44] his defense was even more boomer bust
[15:47] the highlight reels where he's flying
[15:49] all around the court
[15:50] overlook all of his strikeouts and
[15:52] instead focus on his impressive home
[15:54] runs
[15:55] for instance jumping passing lanes like
[15:58] this might produce his most valuable
[16:00] defensive plays
[16:01] these interceptions could be huge pick
[16:04] sixes that went the other way for easy
[16:06] points
[16:07] and at times jordan was like a
[16:08] cornerback sitting on a passing route
[16:10] with elite closing speed in 1989
[16:14] thai aficionado and coach doug collins
[16:17] busted out a half court trap at times
[16:20] allowing mj to size up cross court
[16:22] passes
[16:23] and then turn them into easy offense but
[16:26] these gambles whiffed as well michael
[16:29] would sell out for them frequently
[16:31] and in this case he can cover this kick
[16:33] out pass here
[16:34] but is going for more with the steal and
[16:37] that can lead to wide open looks
[16:40] by my eye jordan hit pay dirt more often
[16:42] than not
[16:43] but there was a tax to pay for these
[16:45] steel attempts
[16:46] he could get in passing lanes without
[16:48] gambling reacting quickly in short space
[16:51] with the defensive equivalent of his
[16:53] first step this
[16:55] is a bread and butter cross screen of
[16:57] the era
[16:58] and jordan not only switches it but
[17:00] pounces like a black cat
[17:02] and he could shoot the gap with that
[17:04] burst this passes airborne for less than
[17:06] half a second
[17:07] and well michael's airborne for
[17:11] more than half a second michael's
[17:14] quickness helped him keep
[17:15] smaller shifty point guards in front of
[17:18] him and on the outside he could churn
[17:20] his feet while swiveling his hips to the
[17:22] dribbler
[17:23] in textbook fashion for instance he
[17:26] often guarded isaiah thomas during the
[17:28] bad boy battles
[17:30] and mj's acceleration allowed him to
[17:32] recover laterally at times
[17:34] and his combination of size strength and
[17:37] agility
[17:38] held isaiah below his normal scoring
[17:39] numbers in those
[17:41] matchups but that kenny rogers gambling
[17:44] was
[17:44] part of his man defense too michael
[17:47] would backpedal to recover a lot
[17:49] and his preferred move there was to
[17:51] swipe down for the steal
[17:53] as he slid in front of a dribbler there
[17:56] was a lot of
[17:56] swiping actually spamming the y button
[17:59] at times
[18:00] and plenty of them connected but they
[18:02] also gave opponents
[18:03] openings that would have been way harder
[18:06] to find
[18:06] if jordan had just played it straight up
[18:10] when he wasn't swiping at the rock he
[18:11] was reaching first on joe dumars here
[18:14] then another reach around for the steal
[18:18] he lunged for steals a lot on the block
[18:20] like this
[18:21] and here that lets the smaller brian
[18:23] shaw turn clear for an easy look
[18:26] mj did flick plenty of balls this way
[18:29] leading to deflections or
[18:30] turnovers man but he was usually overly
[18:34] aggressive with this move
[18:35] lurching at air not once on this play
[18:38] but twice
[18:39] leading to a layup he brought those same
[18:42] habits to the post
[18:43] the swipe down move or a little flick
[18:46] and
[18:46] while he stripped opponents some time i
[18:49] think he was better off playing straight
[18:51] up
[18:51] against post players and using his
[18:54] athleticism and strength to contest
[18:57] against our old friend magic in the 1991
[18:59] finals
[19:00] jordan gambled and then gambled
[19:06] and then gambled
[19:10] and was absolutely torched by the bigger
[19:13] johnson in the post
[19:16] on occasion chicago sent a second
[19:18] defender and you know what happened
[19:21] another defensive gambit jordan loved
[19:23] was the surprise double team
[19:25] where he ambushed unsuspecting players
[19:28] and let those giant hands
[19:29] pickpocket people as carl malone knows
[19:32] all too well
[19:33] these well-timed sniper shots worked
[19:36] against the deliberate post-ops
[19:38] of the 80s and 90s of course there was a
[19:42] small price to pay when he couldn't cash
[19:44] in on these
[19:44] because it left his mark wide open
[19:46] without structured rotations
[19:48] and even after this play turns into a
[19:50] more standard trap
[19:52] it's jordan's man who was wide open the
[19:54] whole time
[19:55] on the other side of the court
[19:58] michael just had an unquenchable thirst
[20:00] to make plays on defense back then
[20:03] he's guarding a shooter here but drifts
[20:05] into the paint looking for action
[20:07] and that was randy whitman's fourth
[20:09] straight jumper
[20:11] jordan lurked like this because he did
[20:13] make a ton of plays from the paint
[20:15] one of his favorites was swooping in at
[20:17] the exact moment post players were
[20:19] shooting
[20:20] and mj was one of the best shot blocking
[20:23] guards of all time
[20:24] able to leverage that athleticism to
[20:26] hang and reach
[20:27] shots and this gave him a level of rim
[20:30] protection
[20:31] that most guards couldn't match these
[20:34] saves at the hoop were high value plays
[20:36] and that defies physics you would be
[20:40] floating above the ground never touching
[20:43] the surface
[20:44] even with a little less verticality by
[20:46] 1990 or 91
[20:48] he could still fly in and save the day
[20:51] this play from 1989 demonstrates the big
[20:55] payoff of jordan lurking near the lane
[20:57] he's able to stop a dunk and this quick
[21:00] reaction
[21:01] and elevation would be elite even for a
[21:03] big man
[21:04] those aerial superpowers even allowed
[21:07] him to protect the rim from behind
[21:09] he served as a backstop here by flying
[21:12] in from the free throw line
[21:13] on this incredible rotation
[21:16] i don't know about you but i find
[21:19] jordan's high-risk defensive style to be
[21:21] difficult to evaluate
[21:23] if we look at our historical impact
[21:25] metrics he's right at the top of the
[21:27] heap
[21:28] with a nice lead in my box plus minus
[21:30] model
[21:31] but it's difficult for stats like these
[21:33] to handle defense
[21:34] well and what we really care about is
[21:37] overall
[21:38] impact so the team here at thinking
[21:40] basketball
[21:41] comb through nearly 200 old jordan games
[21:44] to calculate his plus minus and give us
[21:47] a better picture of his
[21:48] impact in the playoffs from 1989 to 1991
[21:52] jordan's bulls were outscored by 12
[21:55] points every 48 minutes
[21:56] when he sat on the bench but they
[21:59] outscored opponents by
[22:00] 8 points when he played there's some
[22:03] noise in stats like these but
[22:05] chicago's 20-point increase with jordan
[22:08] in the game
[22:09] would rank 9th since the league began
[22:11] tracking this in 1997
[22:13] which puts him up with the all-time
[22:15] results but certainly doesn't separate
[22:17] him from the pack
[22:19] as we've seen he was quick to rotate
[22:22] most of the time
[22:23] here the play unfolds rapidly and
[22:25] michael jumps on the threat
[22:27] but i wouldn't say he had great help
[22:29] awareness
[22:30] he's late recognizing this despite a
[22:32] teammate pointing it out
[22:34] and he could become momentarily
[22:36] preoccupied with action in front of him
[22:38] forgetting to rotate for a second
[22:42] he was a strong enough defensive
[22:43] rebounder as a guard
[22:45] that it probably added some value to his
[22:47] defensive game
[22:49] and given all of his defensive strengths
[22:51] and weaknesses
[22:52] i view him overall as a strong
[22:54] all-league defender
[22:56] but not quite an all-time defensive wing
[23:00] there are still larger questions to
[23:02] think about here
[23:03] how would he fit next to a post player
[23:05] who wanted the ball more
[23:06] are there diminishing returns next to a
[23:08] ball dominant star
[23:10] and what's his legacy look like if
[23:12] scotty pippen never emerged
[23:15] what's undeniable is that jordan was the
[23:17] first perimeter player
[23:18] to dominate with mega scoring and
[23:22] play making which puts him in the
[23:23] conversation for greatest offensive
[23:26] player
[23:26] ever and given his defensive impact
[23:29] it's easy to see why michael jordan
[23:33] is often considered the greatest
[23:35] basketball player
[23:36] of all time

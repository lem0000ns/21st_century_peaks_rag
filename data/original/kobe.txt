[00:00] after michael jordan retired there was a
[00:03] race to crown the
[00:04] heir apparent the next dominant shooting
[00:06] guard who could score
[00:07] pass and defend as we saw last episode
[00:10] kobe certainly fit that bill when he was
[00:13] young
[00:13] 360 degree dunks wild shots
[00:16] and some huge defensive plays under phil
[00:19] jackson's tutelage
[00:20] and that led bryant to be seen as a
[00:23] michael jordan redux because of his
[00:25] build and style but the thing is
[00:28] he wasn't the next michael jordan he was
[00:31] the first kobe bryant
[00:34] you are watching what greatness is all
[00:37] about
[00:38] where's larry bird in all this has it
[00:40] blocked by elijah
[00:42] michael jordan saves the day this series
[00:46] tackles
[00:46] one question who was the best at his
[00:49] best
[00:50] we start at the aba merger and go
[00:52] through the best multi-year stretches
[00:54] examining the legends who provided the
[00:56] most on court impact
[00:58] these are the greatest peaks
[01:08] this is my man this is my man this is
[01:09] showboat we call him showboat but y'all
[01:11] know him as kobe
[01:12] bryant this is my main man mark my words
[01:14] nah and i said this earlier in the
[01:16] season
[01:16] it's gonna be unbelievable kobe was one
[01:19] of the most
[01:20] versatile robust scorers in league
[01:23] history
[01:24] he was kind of like a scoring artist
[01:27] painting the court in just about
[01:28] every way possible there were highlight
[01:30] finishes in the air
[01:32] crafty creative hoops that's a street
[01:35] ball move in a playoff game
[01:37] what's that and everything else
[01:40] fadeaways with his back to the basket
[01:43] pull-up jumpers from the mid-range
[01:45] pull-up jumpers from three even up fakes
[01:49] that send opponents straight to the
[01:50] house of highlights
[01:52] to illustrate this scoring diversity
[01:54] take a look at the shot charts of the
[01:56] leading scorers around this time
[01:58] larger hexagons mean more attempts so
[02:01] you can see lebron's largely
[02:02] rim dominant and dark red indicates a
[02:04] higher shooting percentage compared to
[02:06] league averages now here's
[02:08] kobe for better and sometimes worse
[02:12] he scored from anywhere and everywhere
[02:15] some of this blossomed out of necessity
[02:17] he didn't have mj's first step or
[02:20] lebron's bionic size and strength at the
[02:22] hoop
[02:23] in 2006 a 28 year old brian had a good
[02:26] first step
[02:27] and fluid high level athleticism to
[02:30] build off of as a base
[02:32] he was quick enough to punish slower
[02:34] players or big ben out of water
[02:36] he turned the corner on tim duncan like
[02:37] this a few times in the 2008 western
[02:39] finals
[02:40] but he couldn't just blast by players
[02:43] like certain guards who relied on
[02:45] quickness
[02:46] and it wasn't really acceleration that
[02:48] made kobe a dangerous
[02:50] penetrator he used craft guile and
[02:53] feel a little hesitation to start a
[02:55] drive
[02:56] and he loved this hard spin back at the
[02:58] rim
[03:00] he heads right here but is cut off so
[03:02] the spin
[03:03] sheds the defender and then off the
[03:05] wrong foot adjusts under lebron to
[03:07] finish
[03:08] here it is in transition the hesitation
[03:11] and then
[03:12] feeling the defender recover he spins
[03:14] back hard and leads with his body for
[03:16] free throws
[03:18] these counters took remarkable balance
[03:20] and body control
[03:21] along with great instinct kobe was only
[03:24] around 6'5 barefoot
[03:26] and he couldn't always elevate over
[03:28] defenders at the hoop
[03:30] so instead he might absorb contact while
[03:32] contorting to release a shot
[03:34] although that didn't work every time
[03:37] instead he was snake-like at slithering
[03:40] into different angles to release the
[03:42] ball in traffic
[03:43] his crossover was sharp enough to shake
[03:45] opponents and kobe senses a recovering
[03:48] duncan
[03:48] and angles it right up on the glass but
[03:51] this time the finish is different he's
[03:53] strong enough to stay
[03:54] balanced without losing bruce bowen but
[03:57] because duncan is stationed under the
[03:58] hoop
[03:59] kobe throws his body into him and banks
[04:02] it at his apex
[04:04] this is subtle but his intuition helped
[04:06] him audible at the rim
[04:08] when attacking big men in space he liked
[04:10] that in and out dribble
[04:12] and then altered his stride length as
[04:14] needed
[04:15] approaching the goal perhaps the
[04:18] ultimate example of his malleable
[04:19] finishing
[04:20] was his instinct for flowing to the
[04:22] other side of the rim where he'd throw
[04:24] off a potential shot blocker's timing
[04:26] by striding into a reverse layup
[04:30] now these hesitation moves were so
[04:32] effective because defenses were worried
[04:34] about his
[04:35] pull-up and he could play these threats
[04:37] off each other
[04:38] as the screen comes over duncan and
[04:40] bowen are worried about this shooting
[04:42] pocket
[04:43] and bryant uses that against him with a
[04:45] nasty cross
[04:47] yet the threat of a dribble drive was
[04:49] enough to create airspace for his jump
[04:51] shot
[04:53] defenders had to sell out hard on his
[04:55] mid-range game
[04:56] and that could be a problem for
[04:58] slower-footed opponents
[05:01] kobe had these fundamentals down note
[05:04] how many of his moves come from a triple
[05:06] threat position
[05:07] and involved up fakes or jab steps and
[05:10] he was so proficient getting to his spot
[05:13] and then rising up he could also fire
[05:16] fairly accurate shots off a variety of
[05:19] setups
[05:19] heading to his right or left from just
[05:22] about anywhere on the floor
[05:24] that one was a long two and kobe
[05:27] trafficked in these jumpers just inside
[05:29] the arc
[05:30] which made for impressive shot making
[05:33] but also suppressed his overall scoring
[05:35] efficiency
[05:36] from 2006 to 2008 he attempted more
[05:39] two-point shots
[05:40] outside of 15 feet than anyone in the
[05:42] nba
[05:44] but he only made 41 of them
[05:47] which is exactly what the rest of the
[05:48] league made on these shots during that
[05:50] period kobe's scoring numbers during
[05:53] those seasons were the best of his
[05:55] career
[05:55] but his efficiency lagged a touch behind
[05:58] some of the other huge volume scorers in
[06:00] this
[06:00] series in part because he bled some
[06:03] value by not making those long shots
[06:05] worth three points when they went in he
[06:08] was a bit
[06:09] ahead of the curve with his pull-up
[06:11] three-pointer
[06:12] able to make a respectable 35 percent of
[06:14] these at decent
[06:15] volume many of his shots were really
[06:19] difficult often scoring despite a large
[06:21] hand in his face
[06:23] videographers have sliced together edits
[06:25] of jordan and kobe making similar shots
[06:28] but on this one kobe's is way harder
[06:32] going off of his wrong foot and double
[06:34] clutching before
[06:35] shooting for my money brian is the best
[06:39] tough shot maker in league history
[06:41] or certainly the most prolific he'd
[06:43] regularly drill jumpers with a hand in
[06:45] his face and almost
[06:47] no air space and sometimes he'd fire
[06:49] these at
[06:50] all kinds of crazy angles he's lost all
[06:53] momentum here and his feet are actually
[06:55] crossed when he jumps but hey no biggie
[06:59] we saw some of this feel with larry bird
[07:01] in episode 4
[07:03] subtle little adjustments to change the
[07:05] arc of a shot in a tight spot
[07:07] and this concentration was especially
[07:09] prominent on the backside of his
[07:11] offensive peak
[07:12] at the end of the 2000s where it was a
[07:14] touch harder to generate clean looks
[07:16] so this shooting adaptability took over
[07:20] he could just come to a stop and pump
[07:22] fake players into oblivion
[07:24] and then shoot without any momentum
[07:26] which is
[07:27] crazy difficult on many of these he's
[07:30] jumping from a complete standstill
[07:32] to find just enough room to arc it in
[07:35] and he could trap defenders with these
[07:38] up fakes
[07:38] which helped boosted his free throw
[07:40] rates especially during these peak
[07:42] seasons where he was slightly behind the
[07:44] all-timers but still went to the line
[07:46] more than most players
[07:47] he was also an early practitioner of the
[07:49] rip through move
[07:51] as we discussed in episode 8 with akeem
[07:54] olajuwon
[07:55] these difficult shot attempts helped
[07:56] kobe's play off scoring numbers compared
[07:59] to his regular season ones
[08:01] because he could still generate
[08:02] moderately efficient shots almost on
[08:04] demand
[08:05] even against stingier postseason
[08:07] defenses
[08:08] of course he could score with his back
[08:10] to the basket out of the post
[08:12] where that balance and body control
[08:14] blended with his footwork quite nicely
[08:17] he pivots into a tough shot here but he
[08:19] could just as easily swirl into the lane
[08:21] in the same situation
[08:24] he went to his post game a bit more by
[08:26] the end of the 2000s
[08:27] and he was sturdy enough to bang into
[08:29] little turnarounds
[08:30] or even use the threat of his fadeaway
[08:33] to set up defenders for the old up and
[08:35] under in a sense kobe and shaq were
[08:38] scoring opposites
[08:40] o'neill dominated with incredibly high
[08:42] percentage shots
[08:43] whereas bryant couldn't quite assault
[08:45] the rim with the same frequency
[08:46] so he propped up his scoring with
[08:48] versatility and
[08:50] resilient shot making but if there's one
[08:53] thing we've seen
[08:54] throughout this series it's that scoring
[08:56] alone
[08:57] doesn't make someone a great player
[09:01] but what i'm seeing is i'm seeing an
[09:02] opportunity to really demolish the
[09:04] spirit of their team
[09:05] by attacking carmelo offensively after
[09:08] watching this game
[09:09] i was really really upset with myself i
[09:12] don't see trevor sitting over there on
[09:13] the wing
[09:14] trevor's arms after this shot goes up
[09:17] he didn't pass it to me damn it in the
[09:20] 2008 finals the
[09:22] celtics suffocating defensive scheme
[09:24] defanged
[09:25] bryant clogging his driving lanes and
[09:27] inviting him to take
[09:28] jumpers the celtics overloaded his side
[09:31] when he had possession
[09:32] and this kind of early rotation would
[09:34] have been illegal defense
[09:36] in the 80s or 90s yet it was a strategic
[09:39] departure from what other high-end teams
[09:41] tried
[09:42] against the lakers during their deep
[09:43] playoff runs
[09:45] for instance in the 09 finals orlando
[09:47] played these driving lanes straight
[09:49] up relying on rotations after kobe
[09:52] penetrated
[09:53] without a lightning quick first step to
[09:55] escape these gambits or
[09:57] great size to pressure the rim the
[09:59] celtics held kobe to
[10:00] 51 true shooting and shaved five points
[10:04] off his 2008-2009 playoff scoring
[10:07] a good reminder that playoff matchups
[10:08] can heavily influence numbers
[10:11] boston also banked on kobe looking to
[10:13] score
[10:14] in some of these tight spots instead of
[10:16] repeatedly passing the exact point
[10:18] kobe discussed in that clip against
[10:20] denver when he missed the kick out to
[10:22] trevor ariza
[10:24] here he's covered by a bigger man and
[10:27] forces a tough fade away
[10:28] into a packed paint instead of kicking
[10:30] it out to a good shooter
[10:32] much like we saw in episode 6 with
[10:34] michael jordan
[10:35] kobe was always a little over calibrated
[10:38] towards shooting versus play making
[10:41] here he has two corner options when
[10:43] phoenix collapses into the paint
[10:45] but probes for an extra beat and it's a
[10:47] turnover
[10:49] i don't think this small imbalance
[10:51] chipped away at too much value because
[10:53] kobe could make some of these double
[10:55] team shots
[10:56] and the rest of the time he was looking
[10:58] to punish defenses who loaded up on his
[11:00] scoring like this by
[11:02] finding open teammates he was
[11:05] tactical and often patient about getting
[11:08] opponents to commit
[11:09] to then free up a shooter
[11:12] as that nugget series progressed in 2009
[11:15] whenever
[11:16] denver slid a defender down to spy on
[11:18] him he opted for the kickout pass
[11:21] more and more the year before against
[11:24] the celtics
[11:24] there were certainly moments where he
[11:26] missed early passing chances as he
[11:28] hunted for scoring angles
[11:30] that didn't end all that well yet even
[11:33] in that series he made plenty of early
[11:36] reads
[11:36] a defender is slid way over into his
[11:39] driving lane here
[11:40] so he shuffles it to the open shooter
[11:43] kobe was known for his studiousness and
[11:45] he could certainly
[11:46] read and react to how teams shifted
[11:49] toward him
[11:50] in order to generate easy shots for his
[11:52] bandmates
[11:53] yes he shot into plenty of double teams
[11:55] but he dissected a ton
[11:57] as well boston sends help and these two
[12:00] defenders are covering
[12:01] three lakers and kobe threads a dart
[12:04] into the lane for
[12:05] free throws against the clock kobe grew
[12:08] up idolizing magic
[12:10] johnson and while he wasn't his equal he
[12:12] dropped some
[12:13] gorgeous dimes from time to time or
[12:16] would be dimes some of these passes in
[12:18] dynamic
[12:19] non-traditional situations demonstrated
[12:22] a strong ability to map
[12:24] the court and his athleticism helped
[12:26] with a variety of passing deliveries
[12:28] here he feels the help in the air looks
[12:30] for his big man and just tries to slap
[12:33] it
[12:33] in his direction most of his best passes
[12:37] were to
[12:38] big men like this there's that patience
[12:40] to wait for help to leave pau gasol
[12:42] and this one takes even sharper vision
[12:45] finding the rim runner with a
[12:46] jump pass to the front of the cylinder
[12:49] over the course of his career kobe's
[12:52] best most consistent pass was probably
[12:54] the laydown
[12:56] something he always had great feel for
[12:58] occasionally he'd shoot in these spots
[13:00] but if he sensed a defender coming over
[13:02] on a drive
[13:03] he'd usually hone in on his open big man
[13:07] here he spots a teammate on the backside
[13:09] maybe the perfect pass arrives
[13:11] now but kobe knows if he collapses the
[13:13] zone an easier angle will emerge
[13:15] so he air drops it over for the layup
[13:18] and hey
[13:19] walton's back sort of where were we
[13:22] laydowns kobe would carve these out and
[13:24] then was able to deliver at a variety of
[13:27] angles
[13:28] depending on the situation going with a
[13:30] soft lefty lob here
[13:32] after being corralled on his drive
[13:35] the other option in those spots was the
[13:37] kick out where if defenders pinched down
[13:39] from the perimeter
[13:40] he could spray it back out for three
[13:42] point practice
[13:44] after two hesitation moves he runs into
[13:46] a wall here
[13:47] but since the guard sinks in to help on
[13:49] gasol the kickout becomes the weakness
[13:51] to exploit
[13:53] using our best estimates kobe created
[13:56] plenty of shots like this for teammates
[13:58] ranking behind only jordan james harden
[14:00] lebron james and tracy
[14:02] mcgrady among non-point guards
[14:05] point guard is sort of a misnomer here
[14:07] since these are all
[14:08] lead guards spearheading the entire
[14:10] offense as dual threats
[14:12] for instance kobe ran plenty of spread
[14:14] pick and roll notice all the extra space
[14:17] compared to
[14:18] prior episodes and he could score or
[14:21] play make out of this action
[14:23] he didn't really have an ideal pick and
[14:25] roll partner before gasol
[14:27] although andrew bynum's emergence as a
[14:29] roll threat provided a little chemistry
[14:31] in 2007.
[14:33] when pow did arrive in 08 kobe ran the
[14:36] two-man game with him more frequently
[14:38] and he could pop or roll comfortably
[14:40] next to bryant
[14:42] there's a little manipulation from kobe
[14:44] by using the no look pass to hold the
[14:46] defender
[14:47] that one didn't always work but it shows
[14:50] the capacity for
[14:51] higher level ideas he could also make
[14:54] the little pocket pass
[14:56] this one is delayed until the big
[14:58] commits to kobe
[14:59] and then he threads the needle
[15:00] beautifully
[15:02] and while he didn't anticipate tons of
[15:05] passes
[15:06] he could drop wonderful dimes after
[15:08] reacting to the defense
[15:10] the big man contests so he audibles by
[15:12] bouncing it through a tight
[15:14] window the kobe pow pick and roll was a
[15:18] nasty option to fall back on late in a
[15:21] possession
[15:22] that look away technique holds the help
[15:24] defense
[15:25] this time it's successful and pow could
[15:27] pass off the roll
[15:28] too on this one the defense sits
[15:31] on gassol's roll so kobe whips it to
[15:34] lamar odum
[15:35] who makes the extra pass and both laker
[15:37] big men could pass or finish in these
[15:39] spots
[15:40] 2008 was a huge upgrade in roster
[15:44] construction from prior seasons
[15:45] where mediocre shooters and passers
[15:48] flanked kobe lamar and utility big men
[15:51] odom was always able to create some
[15:53] offense and act as a secondary playmaker
[15:56] next to kobe
[15:57] but gasol took the lakers to another
[15:59] level with his diverse offensive package
[16:02] his post game made him an all-nba level
[16:05] player
[16:06] stocked with a full pantry of post moves
[16:09] that includes soft touches with his
[16:11] right and left hand
[16:12] around the basket and after his arrival
[16:16] the
[16:16] lakers offense exploded from 2008 to
[16:19] 2010
[16:21] la's playoff efficiency was about six
[16:23] and a half points better
[16:24] than what their opponents allowed in the
[16:26] regular season
[16:27] since kobe's offense slowed down a bit
[16:30] chopping off 2010 might better capture
[16:33] this
[16:33] team at its brief peak a fantastic
[16:36] stretch that was a rung
[16:37] down from the all-time greats
[16:40] there were a few holes in kobe's passing
[16:42] game
[16:43] he was willing to try tight passes this
[16:46] one is picked off
[16:47] but it's also a delivery issue where if
[16:49] he doesn't throw it higher
[16:50] he needs to throw it earlier or with a
[16:52] different delivery angle altogether
[16:55] he didn't really whip fastballs off the
[16:57] dribble at different angles like some
[16:59] players
[17:00] and instead he often tried some of these
[17:01] tight squeezes well in the air in
[17:04] lieu of shooting these all might be
[17:06] audibles out of shots
[17:08] but i wonder if he went to the jump pass
[17:10] because he wasn't that
[17:11] big size could bother him on traps and
[17:14] lead to some blind spots
[17:16] we saw the much taller lamar odom make
[17:18] this exact pass a second ago
[17:20] and kobe was inconsistent about hitting
[17:23] the roll man on this action
[17:25] when the defending big man jumped him
[17:27] hard
[17:28] he also missed some straightforward
[17:31] passes
[17:32] that's there for the taking and in my
[17:34] study he mostly seemed to miss wings and
[17:36] smalls
[17:37] in these home run situations so while he
[17:39] had some limitations as a passer
[17:42] his playmaking was an enormous part of
[17:44] his offensive attack
[17:46] but his offense wasn't nearly as
[17:48] polarizing
[17:49] as his controversial defense
[17:54] bryant's size was also a small factor on
[17:57] the defensive
[17:58] end for instance he had mixed results
[18:00] holding down the fort against bigger
[18:02] stronger players in the post there are
[18:05] some plays where the engagement isn't
[18:07] entirely there
[18:08] and then others where he battles hard
[18:10] with more success
[18:13] similarly kobe wasn't much of a vertical
[18:15] presence around the basket
[18:18] when he was near the rim he often went
[18:20] to a swipe down move
[18:22] and sometimes these connected
[18:23] beautifully and did the trick
[18:26] on occasion he'd turn a running start
[18:28] into a highlight block
[18:29] but these high leverage plays were less
[18:32] common
[18:33] kobe averaged a block every other game
[18:35] during these years
[18:36] and only provided occasional rim
[18:38] protection as a guard
[18:40] these rotations in the paint can provide
[18:43] tons of value for a wing
[18:45] and kobe could be floor-bound on them
[18:47] and he couldn't afford to arrive
[18:49] late in these spots he should have
[18:51] rotated here once the double team
[18:53] arrived
[18:54] although in general he was usually
[18:56] pretty buttoned up with most of his
[18:58] rotations
[18:59] tagging the big man in pick and roll
[19:01] either from the baseline or
[19:02] elbow area and this is a great sequence
[19:05] where he
[19:06] re-helps on the drive then recognizes
[19:09] the corner
[19:09] is open and runs the shooter off the
[19:11] line
[19:13] unlike the facial he received a second
[19:15] ago this time he's early helping the
[19:18] helper
[19:19] and being early on these rotations is
[19:21] key for a wing versus a big man
[19:24] he can deter the pass or deflect it but
[19:27] arrive a step later and he would swipe
[19:29] for the ball and that's a foul
[19:32] around 2007 brian emerged as a
[19:35] vocal leader on defense you can see him
[19:38] pointing on this play as la switches a
[19:40] number of actions here
[19:43] and this was in conjunction with the
[19:45] lakers playing more complex schemes
[19:47] they zoned up or switched the weak side
[19:50] constantly
[19:51] as the league adopted more pick and roll
[19:53] offense
[19:54] although these rotations weren't always
[19:56] super crisp for example he's a little
[19:58] late sliding here and that leads to a
[20:00] desperate closeout
[20:03] in general kobe wasn't super active on
[20:05] the weak side like this
[20:07] not making a ton of plays that's sort of
[20:09] an errant gamble there
[20:11] and when he staked out these situations
[20:14] he was quite
[20:14] vulnerable to backdoor cuts
[20:17] he was actually vulnerable to backdoors
[20:20] in general throughout his career
[20:22] tracking the ball a bit too hard and
[20:25] when zoning two he took a somewhat
[20:26] extreme stance
[20:28] toward the ball handler and could idle a
[20:30] bit and
[20:31] this responsibility is really about
[20:34] anticipation
[20:35] and effort it's what made larry bird
[20:37] dangerous in these spots
[20:39] and i'm not sure kobe had the motor to
[20:41] go full tilt on plays like these
[20:43] and carry his enormous offensive load
[20:46] back on
[20:47] offense bryant drained additional fuel
[20:49] by moving without the ball
[20:51] regularly working for a better position
[20:53] in the post and staying active in order
[20:56] to pressure defenses
[20:58] when he was overplayed he had a nice
[21:00] back cut himself
[21:01] to escape defenders and he could
[21:04] comfortably flow into catch and shoot
[21:06] options in the mid-range this meant he
[21:09] could fit well next to
[21:10] other high-level passers but it also
[21:12] meant that he couldn't
[21:13] rest much on offense so without an
[21:16] all-time motor
[21:18] kobe couldn't go full throttle on
[21:19] defense for 40 minutes as well
[21:22] here he lapses for just a moment and
[21:25] loses contact with ray allen
[21:27] they wisely switched him off allen for
[21:29] the rest of the series after this
[21:31] and while he could do solid work chasing
[21:33] players around
[21:34] he wasn't ideal for this kind of task at
[21:37] this point in his career
[21:39] he could get a bit stuck at times
[21:41] navigating around screens
[21:43] especially against bigger screeners like
[21:45] this although he was
[21:47] pretty good at dipping his shoulder
[21:48] around them and staying
[21:50] fairly connected to his man his footwork
[21:54] in these spots wasn't always
[21:55] perfect big steps can make it tricky to
[21:57] bypass screens
[21:59] but kobe works hard to recover and stay
[22:02] in front of the ball here
[22:04] he couldn't always bring this level of
[22:06] intensity he kind of hops his way out of
[22:08] position against a dangerous pull-up
[22:10] three-point shooter here
[22:12] although when he did go all out he could
[22:14] provide good point of attack defense
[22:16] and this on-ball defense is what kept
[22:18] him on all defensive teams
[22:20] long after his defensive peak that we
[22:23] saw in the last episode
[22:25] he was versatile guarding the perimeter
[22:28] able to chip away a little at bigger
[22:30] forwards and in particular
[22:32] switch onto point guards he had fairly
[22:36] quick feet and
[22:37] used angles and his size well in their
[22:40] 2008 series
[22:41] kobe had successful moments against the
[22:43] lightning quick tony parker
[22:45] and here you'll notice he shades him
[22:47] left by design
[22:48] into the help bryant seems as studious
[22:51] and technical with his defense
[22:53] as he was with his offense only he
[22:55] wasn't that disruptive as a defender
[22:58] blowing up screening actions or flying
[23:00] into the lane to choke out advantages
[23:03] this is a great bit of awareness in
[23:05] transition sliding over to stop the ball
[23:08] but plays like that were rare during
[23:10] these years and
[23:11] kobe's steel rate was around the 75th
[23:14] percentile historically
[23:15] which was good but not great for a guard
[23:19] as we've seen he could attack the ball
[23:21] by pawing at it like this
[23:23] although there were a number of plays
[23:25] where he was reaching for a steal
[23:27] and that left him out of position in a
[23:30] 2007 game phil jackson said he had some
[23:32] river boat gambler in him and while i
[23:35] don't think he gambled nearly as much as
[23:36] someone like
[23:37] jordan he had his fair share of whiffs
[23:41] he liked to shoot the gap and this was
[23:43] also how he collected some of his steels
[23:45] and those interceptions were more
[23:47] memorable and look great on highlight
[23:49] reels
[23:51] kobe also had his fair share of blow bys
[23:54] off the dribble against quicker guards
[23:56] although some great defenders can be
[23:58] susceptible to breakdowns like this
[24:00] so i don't think they chipped away at
[24:02] too much of his value
[24:04] impact metrics like adjusted plus minus
[24:06] or pipm
[24:08] tend to view him as a round neutral on
[24:10] defense
[24:11] and i think that's in the right ballpark
[24:14] given his lack of involvement in the
[24:16] paint
[24:16] and sporadic guarding of opposing lead
[24:19] guards
[24:20] but despite his lack of a defensive
[24:22] motor i think his understanding of
[24:24] schemes combined with his
[24:26] versatility to provide effective point
[24:28] of attack defense
[24:30] against three positions makes him a
[24:32] small positive
[24:33] on that end the more interesting
[24:36] question
[24:36] is just how high were his offensive
[24:39] heights
[24:39] he could be shot heavy at times but his
[24:42] insane
[24:43] shot making provided a ton of resiliency
[24:46] in the playoffs
[24:47] after all the only defense to really
[24:49] slow him down during those years
[24:51] was the historically great celtics while
[24:54] most of his value came with the ball his
[24:57] off-ball skills were strong enough to
[24:59] provide
[25:00] impact next to other high-level
[25:02] teammates
[25:03] and so while his defense might keep him
[25:06] from competing with the best of the very
[25:08] best it's easy to see why so many people
[25:11] view kobe bryant as one of the best
[25:14] offensive players
[25:16] to ever grace the hardwood

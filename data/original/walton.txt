[00:00] there's a mythology about bill walton
[00:02] that few players can match
[00:04] blazer mania that fiery mountain man
[00:07] beard
[00:08] and countless injuries that ended his
[00:10] prime as soon as it began
[00:13] his first two seasons were shortened by
[00:15] an assortment of ailments before
[00:17] a brief two-year stretch in 1977 and
[00:20] 1978
[00:21] that yielded an nba championship and an
[00:24] mvp trophy
[00:26] so just how good were those two seasons
[00:29] was that brief peak enough to compete
[00:31] with the most dominant centers in nba
[00:33] history
[00:34] and was he the greatest passing big man
[00:37] of all time
[00:44] larry bird in all this has it blocked by
[00:46] elijah
[00:48] michael jordan saves the day this series
[00:51] tackles
[00:52] one question who was the best at his
[00:55] best
[00:56] we started the aba merger and go through
[00:58] the best multi-year stretches
[00:59] examining the legends who provided the
[01:01] most on-court impact
[01:04] these are the greatest peaks
[01:12] [Applause]
[01:14] [Music]
[01:16] [Applause]
[01:17] [Music]
[01:20] before we can estimate walton's impact
[01:23] it's important to
[01:24] understand the way the game was played
[01:25] before the three-point line
[01:27] with so many shots funneled into the
[01:29] paint and no extra point for stretching
[01:31] out the court
[01:32] defensive big men were titans back then
[01:35] the definitive basketball archetype
[01:37] wasn't a high-flying scoring guard but a
[01:39] dominant
[01:40] center and no not wilt chamberlain but
[01:43] his rival bill russell
[01:45] russell's defensive genius reigned over
[01:48] the prior decade
[01:49] where he won five mvps without being a
[01:52] heavy scorer on
[01:53] offense that's worth repeating will
[01:56] chamberlain once
[01:57] averaged 50 points per game in a season
[02:00] but the zeitgeist of the time was
[02:02] to play like russell in 1967
[02:06] after years of volume scoring
[02:08] chamberlain's own coach asked him to
[02:10] play like russell
[02:11] shoot less pass more protect the paint
[02:14] and this led to a new record for wins
[02:16] and an
[02:17] end to the celtics eight consecutive
[02:19] title streak
[02:20] the search for the next russell peaked
[02:23] in 1969
[02:24] when a rookie wes unseld won the mvp by
[02:27] playing a
[02:28] team-centric pass rebound and defend
[02:30] role that russell was glorified for
[02:32] playing
[02:33] and that's exactly how walton played
[02:36] only with greater scoring skill
[02:38] than either unseld or russell as a
[02:41] sophomore in college
[02:43] he was compared to both rust and
[02:45] chamberlain
[02:46] and is a junior authored arguably the
[02:48] greatest single game performance
[02:50] in ncaa history going 21 of
[02:53] 22 from the floor in route to 44 points
[02:57] and his 60th win in 60 college games up
[03:01] until that point
[03:03] not too shabby the grainy signs of his
[03:06] offensive repertoire were on display
[03:08] the bank shot his activity dexterity and
[03:11] of course
[03:12] the passing like most players walton
[03:15] probably peaked as a passer later in his
[03:17] career
[03:18] especially with slightly more space to
[03:20] work with in the 1980s
[03:22] back in 77 and 78 at the height of his
[03:25] overall powers
[03:26] his passing was defined by hitting
[03:28] swirling cutters from the mid and high
[03:30] post
[03:31] area some of these were like water polo
[03:34] passes just
[03:35] flipping the ball over heads in really
[03:37] tight quarters
[03:39] but the defining characteristic of these
[03:40] passes was speed
[03:42] and accuracy older centers could
[03:45] occasionally throw
[03:46] flashier passes than walton from these
[03:48] cornerstone
[03:49] spots but walton's volume and efficiency
[03:52] was
[03:53] unmatched until that point in time note
[03:55] his little hop
[03:56] to create a better delivery angle over
[03:58] the top portland's
[04:00] half court game was largely built off
[04:03] cutters buzzing around walton like this
[04:05] he has multiple options here if there's
[04:07] any opening
[04:08] and his speed accuracy combination
[04:11] resembles a modern quarterback
[04:13] throwing tight short yardage completions
[04:16] today we might just see a crowded lane
[04:18] where everyone's covered but
[04:19] walton sees a pass behind the hoop the
[04:22] only window to thread this needle
[04:24] through
[04:25] compare that to another blazer big lloyd
[04:28] neal
[04:28] who misses a walton special here only to
[04:31] have big red
[04:32] show him how it's done walton's vision
[04:36] stems from reading the game so well at
[04:38] the team
[04:39] level knowing who's supposed to go where
[04:41] and what options are available
[04:44] with the overplay on the pass he leads
[04:45] the cutter into space
[04:47] and again what accuracy on the release
[04:50] walton's also known for his outlet
[04:52] passing and he mostly flung these toward
[04:54] the mid court after
[04:56] ripping down a rebound it was almost
[04:58] like a single motion
[04:59] grabbing and firing to start portland's
[05:02] vaunted fast break
[05:03] but he wasn't throwing touchdowns on
[05:05] these like some of the other great
[05:06] outlet passers of that era already were
[05:09] and in the limited game footage in
[05:11] public the one he tried got away from
[05:13] him a bit
[05:16] his more notable weakness to me is
[05:17] passing on the move
[05:19] his handle wasn't really functional and
[05:21] that meant that his half-court passing
[05:23] was
[05:23] largely stationary limited to whatever
[05:26] outpost he caught the ball from
[05:27] of course most big men at the time
[05:30] couldn't pass on the move
[05:31] nor was the game conducive to them
[05:33] running pick and roll
[05:34] so relative to his time walton was
[05:38] certainly among the best passing bigs to
[05:40] come along
[05:40] and perhaps the best ever at finding
[05:43] cutters
[05:45] all of walton's missed games from injury
[05:47] give us insight into his value for
[05:49] portland
[05:50] in games where walton was the only
[05:52] missing rotational player
[05:53] portland assisted on 54 of its field
[05:56] goals
[05:57] in 1977 and 1978. add walton in and that
[06:00] number
[06:01] jumped to nearly 58 his outlet passing
[06:04] had a similar effect on
[06:06] pace with walton the blazers played at a
[06:08] slightly above average pace for the time
[06:11] and without him they averaged four fewer
[06:13] possessions a game
[06:14] which would have made them one of the
[06:15] slower teams in the league
[06:17] the total effect on offense was that the
[06:20] blazers were 3.7 points better than
[06:22] average with him
[06:24] but only 1.2 points better without him
[06:27] that is still a solid offense without
[06:29] big bill largely because his
[06:31] replacements were good scores tom owens
[06:34] averaged 19 points per game and four
[06:36] assists in 1979
[06:38] and the aforementioned lloyd neal was a
[06:40] good scorer too
[06:42] walton was a similar scorer to those two
[06:44] at least statistically
[06:46] going to that jump hook as a bread and
[06:48] butter move
[06:49] he had nice touch on this and while it
[06:51] certainly wasn't the sky hook
[06:53] that's for the next episode bill could
[06:55] release this cleanly most of the time
[06:57] without too much of a setup
[06:59] it was a back to the basket move but it
[07:01] was also used at the end of a little
[07:03] face up like this when headed right
[07:06] he could also knock down mid-range
[07:08] jumpers preferring to go glass on these
[07:10] whenever possible
[07:12] big red could walk into these but also
[07:14] liked a turn around after a single
[07:17] dribble
[07:18] his range on these jumpers was maybe out
[07:21] to 17 or 18 feet
[07:22] probably limited by that funky form that
[07:25] kept his free throw shooting around 70
[07:27] percent
[07:28] at his peak his scoring moves were
[07:31] decisive like this but he didn't possess
[07:33] an overwhelming scoring arsenal
[07:35] adjusted for inflation to 2020 numbers
[07:38] walden averaged about
[07:39] 20 to 21 points per 75 possessions
[07:42] during this two-year peak and his
[07:44] scoring efficiency was four to five
[07:46] percentage points ahead of the league
[07:49] interestingly his scoring did slide a
[07:51] touch in his 19 playoff games
[07:53] averaging closer to 17 points per 75
[07:56] when adjusting for inflation
[07:58] with slightly lower efficiency than in
[08:00] the regular season
[08:02] during that 77 playoff run walton was
[08:05] the second leading scorer on the team
[08:07] but
[08:07] only the fourth leading scorer when
[08:09] adjusting for pace
[08:10] a testament to portland's balanced
[08:12] attack built off of walton's passing
[08:15] but the blazers weren't a dominant
[08:17] playoff offense
[08:18] in part because of bill's shortcoming as
[08:20] a scorer
[08:22] he also added value with his activity
[08:25] first as a cutter
[08:26] knowing when to read this opening for a
[08:28] dive cut and lob
[08:30] this kind of off-ball play adds value
[08:33] around higher end talent
[08:34] and it led to this vintage blazer mania
[08:36] sequence in the 1977 finals against
[08:39] philadelphia
[08:41] [Applause]
[08:44] walton was always looking for little
[08:46] soft spots in the defense
[08:48] finding offensive rebounding
[08:49] opportunities and high percentage second
[08:51] chance points
[08:52] that cleaned up for his teammates he
[08:55] wasn't a
[08:56] skywalker but his size and quick leaping
[08:59] allowed him to finish plays around the
[09:00] rim
[09:01] and score off of rebounds like this
[09:03] boosting his scoring numbers a bit in
[09:05] the process
[09:06] with these high percentage follow-ups by
[09:09] the way
[09:09] walton was huge his height is debated
[09:12] but
[09:13] he wasn't much smaller than kareem
[09:14] abdul-jabbar who stood 7-2 without
[09:17] shoes and here he is next to robert
[09:19] parish
[09:20] listed at 7-1 and kevin mchale listed at
[09:23] 6
[09:23] 10. that size contributed to his
[09:26] crippling injuries
[09:28] as his feet weren't anatomically capable
[09:30] of supporting his big frame
[09:31] and the shock of all that running and
[09:33] jumping
[09:35] walton missed three full seasons before
[09:37] ramping his career back up in 1983 in
[09:39] san diego
[09:40] again he's not dwarfed by kareem here at
[09:42] all but
[09:44] boy did that size and mobility help him
[09:46] protect the paint
[09:48] walton's massive impact on the game his
[09:50] very inclusion in this series
[09:52] is primarily because of his defensive
[09:55] value
[09:56] value created with his length awareness
[09:58] and motor
[09:59] most seven footers aren't super active
[10:02] and able to read the game but back
[10:04] before the three-point line this was
[10:05] arguably the most
[10:06] valuable trait in the entire
[10:09] sport we'll see why in a moment
[10:14] filming birds of prey is not for those
[10:15] who have a fear of heights i graduated
[10:17] from the practice tree to the 200-foot
[10:19] monster
[10:20] to bring her up beautiful to fly and
[10:23] hold the eagle was a landmark of my life
[10:25] was a classic paint protector and
[10:27] because of the rules back then
[10:28] he almost served like a goaltender
[10:31] patrolling the area in front of the hoop
[10:32] and challenging all comers the dangerous
[10:35] doug
[10:35] collins runs into a wall here or or i
[10:38] guess a
[10:39] wall tin there's a good joke in there
[10:41] somewhere
[10:42] but bill was always really well
[10:44] positioned he
[10:46] sagged off players without the ball in
[10:47] textbook fashion but was ready to pounce
[10:50] in these spots
[10:51] he was one of the most active big
[10:53] defenders in league history
[10:55] helping when needed or stepping out in
[10:57] challenging shots in the mid range
[10:58] ambushing pete maravich here who thought
[11:00] he was in the clear
[11:02] you'll notice his hands are always out
[11:04] clogging passing lanes so teams don't
[11:06] sneak those dimes through to cutters
[11:08] like the blazers did
[11:09] and his hands were active targeting the
[11:12] ball here deflecting this jump pass
[11:15] like great rim protectors he was
[11:17] accurate jabbing at the basketball
[11:19] and he would pull his hand away to avoid
[11:21] fouling at times
[11:23] bill's quick bunny hop couldn't get him
[11:25] over the top of the square like some of
[11:27] the great modern
[11:28] shot blockers and this meant that
[11:30] occasionally strong athletes or crafty
[11:32] finishers
[11:33] could slip one through here he slides
[11:36] down in position
[11:38] but miss times his jump and that throws
[11:40] off the contest a bit
[11:42] but his typical reactions were quick and
[11:44] with
[11:45] sound position he bothered so many shots
[11:49] he wasn't a stiff either comfortably
[11:51] chasing wings outside the paint
[11:53] to harass their jumpers remember back
[11:56] then biggs couldn't really be exposed on
[11:58] an island against quicker players
[12:00] because they didn't have to chase out to
[12:01] the three-point line
[12:03] the game in those days was built more
[12:05] around the post-up with
[12:07] offenses running through the center
[12:09] unlike walton most high end big men were
[12:12] looking to score
[12:13] more than pass and that created even
[12:15] more defensive responsibility
[12:17] for the bigs of that era in the 1977
[12:20] western conference finals
[12:21] walton famously battled cream of
[12:23] duljabar for four games
[12:25] trying his best to sit on kareem's
[12:27] lethal skyhook
[12:28] and force him left with mixed results
[12:32] that's better than most against jabbar
[12:34] and walton's size
[12:35] and acumen helped slow kareem a bit
[12:38] compared to normal centers
[12:40] here he tracks him well without the ball
[12:42] happily forcing jabar left
[12:44] but sometimes there's no stopping kareem
[12:47] walton
[12:47] also stayed active working for better
[12:49] defensive position
[12:51] here leading to a steal and against more
[12:53] mortal figures
[12:54] his man defense was highly effective
[12:57] banging and then going vertical against
[12:59] daryl dawkins in the 77 finals
[13:02] squint a bit and you'll see hall of
[13:04] famer dan issel more of a shooting
[13:05] center
[13:06] get stuffed by walton on this jumper and
[13:08] bill was always using his size and
[13:10] positioning to defend opponents like
[13:12] this
[13:13] he was the original big fundamental
[13:16] taking a textbook approach to activity
[13:19] positioning
[13:20] vertical contests and so on we can see
[13:23] the effect his manned defense had on
[13:25] opponents during this 1977 and 78
[13:27] stretch
[13:28] by looking at the 48 games he played
[13:30] against other all-star
[13:32] centers for instance kareem averaged
[13:34] 25.9 points per 36 minutes
[13:37] on 61 true shooting against everyone
[13:40] else
[13:40] but in eight games against walton
[13:42] averaged 24 and a half
[13:44] on 57 true shooting if we do this for
[13:48] the other seven all-star centers during
[13:50] these years
[13:51] only big bob lanier and another southpaw
[13:53] dave cowans
[13:54] avoid a pretty clear drop off against
[13:57] walton
[13:58] now team factors influence data like
[14:00] this but numbers like these crystallize
[14:03] the effect of a superstar defender
[14:05] in total these all-stars scored nearly
[14:07] two fewer points per 36
[14:09] on four percent worse true shooting
[14:11] against walton
[14:12] an effect that compares favorably to all
[14:14] but the all-time great
[14:16] post defenders in many ways portland was
[14:18] built around walton on both
[14:20] ends their guards could be more
[14:22] aggressive pressuring the ball with big
[14:24] bill behind them
[14:25] while portland didn't need another paint
[14:27] protector out there to take away from
[14:29] its speed and
[14:30] skill game on offense if we go back to
[14:33] those games walton missed
[14:34] we can see how insanely valuable his
[14:37] defense was
[14:38] the blazers gave up about 103 points per
[14:40] 100
[14:41] in the 26 games with just walton missing
[14:44] but
[14:44] only 95.6 with him in the lineup
[14:48] a jump from the third worst defense in
[14:50] the league to the very
[14:51] best defense in the league this is
[14:54] likely beyond the offensive impact of
[14:56] any player in the first 30 years of the
[14:58] league perhaps save for
[15:00] oscar robertson or jerry west
[15:03] overall the blazers were actually
[15:05] outscored in those two seasons without
[15:08] walton they had a negative adjusted
[15:10] point differential
[15:11] equivalent to a 37 win team but with him
[15:14] they had a
[15:15] plus eight and a half point differential
[15:18] a 64 win pace
[15:20] among players to miss at least 20 games
[15:22] over a single or multi-year period
[15:24] that nearly 10 point increase with
[15:26] walton is the second largest in the
[15:29] first
[15:29] 70 years of the nba and that came in an
[15:32] era of parody
[15:33] where winning 55 games was rare
[15:37] only nate thurmond another defensive
[15:39] stud was associated with a larger
[15:41] increase
[15:42] but his team was far worse than those
[15:43] blazers who went a stunning 87 and 28 in
[15:47] those games with big bill
[15:48] and just 10 and 16 without him
[15:51] again most of that value was defensive
[15:54] so
[15:54] fittingly it was the blazers defense
[15:57] that shined in 19 playoff games
[15:59] holding opponents nearly five and a half
[16:01] points below their regular season
[16:03] scoring efficiencies
[16:05] in those two seasons walton and company
[16:07] also played eight games without their
[16:08] only other all-star
[16:10] maurice lucas and in those eight games
[16:12] the blazers went
[16:14] 8-n-o these indicators with players
[16:18] moving in and out of the lineup
[16:19] do still have some noise we can't say
[16:22] for certain walton was worth nine and a
[16:23] half points but
[16:25] 26 games is enough to know that he was
[16:27] likely worth at least say
[16:29] six points to those blazers and that's
[16:32] an historically huge
[16:33] number combine that with other factors
[16:36] like lucas's miss time
[16:37] the playoff performance and what we can
[16:39] see on film and it's clear walton was
[16:41] the linchpin of a budding dynasty
[16:45] in 1979 with michael thompson clay's dad
[16:48] replacing walton in the starting lineup
[16:50] and some minor bench changes
[16:52] the blazers reverted back to playing
[16:54] just over 500 basketball
[16:56] reinforcing bill's massive impact
[16:59] i think it's fair to look at their team
[17:00] construction and think that there isn't
[17:02] another center
[17:03] in league history who could have
[17:05] maximized that fit
[17:07] as well as the big redhead
[17:10] our best impact metrics that reach back
[17:12] in time view
[17:13] walton as having say a top 40 peak in
[17:16] playoff history
[17:17] his two-year regular season numbers were
[17:19] similar by the way and
[17:20] these metrics respect his defense likely
[17:23] reflecting how
[17:24] excellent his fit in portland was but
[17:27] even in a less optimal situation they
[17:30] still suggest that he belongs in this
[17:31] kind of conversation
[17:33] and given how well his defense and his
[17:36] passing
[17:36] would travel to other teams i don't
[17:39] think there are 10
[17:40] centers in nba history who peaked higher
[17:44] than bill walton

[00:00] [Music]
[00:00] many people view hakeem alajawan's two
[00:02] championships in the middle of the 90s
[00:05] as a kind of interim title belt on rent
[00:08] while michael jordan swung away at
[00:10] curveballs
[00:11] but maybe hakeem should have been in the
[00:13] best player conversation
[00:14] before jordan retired maybe his
[00:17] dazzling scoring repertoire unlocks
[00:20] something special in the playoffs
[00:22] and maybe that incredible defense made
[00:25] him one of the very best players
[00:27] of the three-point era
[00:31] you are watching what greatness is all
[00:33] about
[00:34] where's larry bird in all this has it
[00:37] blocked by elijah
[00:39] michael jordan saves the day this series
[00:42] tackles
[00:43] one question who was the best at his
[00:46] best
[00:47] we start at the aba merger and go
[00:48] through the best multi-year stretches
[00:50] examining the legends who provided the
[00:52] most on-court impact
[00:55] these are the greatest peaks
[01:03] i was playing other sports soccer
[01:05] volleyball philadelphia
[01:07] i jump more of all around athletes but
[01:12] the coach was telling me that basketball
[01:14] is your game
[01:16] hakeem's defensive highlights have the
[01:18] grandiosity of some nfl films montage
[01:22] no one at nba history recorded boar
[01:24] block shots than a cable lager won
[01:28] even though he was closer to 610 than a
[01:30] true seven feet
[01:32] his incredible combination of
[01:33] athleticism and timing
[01:35] made him feel like a very tall oliver
[01:38] khan
[01:38] on the basketball court this sequence
[01:41] epitomizes how impregnable he could be
[01:43] at the rim
[01:44] scottie pippen turns the corner with
[01:46] dream pulled up top
[01:47] and otis thorpe has no chance against
[01:49] the explosive pippen
[01:51] but when chicago runs this with hakeem
[01:54] as the low man
[01:55] elijahwan spits the dunk back in
[01:57] scotty's face
[01:58] and pippin has a runway and is above the
[02:01] square
[02:01] and he still goes and gets it it's not
[02:05] any easier trying to glide around hakeem
[02:08] because that long
[02:09] right hockey stick finds the basketball
[02:11] as he twists in the air
[02:14] the first cornerstone of his shot
[02:15] blocking brilliance was his accuracy
[02:18] targeting the ball with that domineering
[02:20] right hand
[02:21] notice the hand tracks with the path of
[02:23] the ball as it
[02:24] shot even in his younger days when he
[02:27] was slightly less polished
[02:28] he was incredibly accurate targeting the
[02:31] rock
[02:32] and growing up as a handball player
[02:34] primed him to zero in on the ball like
[02:36] this
[02:37] hakeem didn't play basketball in nigeria
[02:39] until he was about
[02:40] 16 so it was really volleyball that
[02:43] groomed his jumping technique
[02:46] he'd patiently prepare to spring up and
[02:48] wait till the precise moment
[02:50] to commit to a shot he holds until
[02:53] sean elliot's airborne then spikes this
[02:55] thing
[02:56] this is subtle and requires great
[02:58] reflexes but when alejand moved around
[03:01] the paint he was constantly ready to
[03:03] jump which allowed him to attack
[03:05] after a shooter left his feet it's on
[03:08] display here
[03:10] where he slides over to contest but when
[03:12] elliot hesitates
[03:13] hakeem shuffles his feet into a new
[03:15] jumping position
[03:16] and sends it back in his face
[03:22] this is an incredible skill allowing him
[03:25] to
[03:25] slide into position for a save yet he
[03:28] doesn't jump
[03:29] instead controlling his body and waiting
[03:31] for the moment the shooter finally puts
[03:33] it up
[03:35] he probably learned some of this playing
[03:37] his third major sport growing up
[03:39] soccer where fittingly he played
[03:41] goalkeeper
[03:42] foreshadowing his career as the nba's
[03:44] all-time leader in blocks
[03:47] hakeem registered at least five blocks
[03:49] in 35
[03:51] of his playoff games from 1986 to 1994
[03:54] and in those last two years had five in
[03:56] nearly
[03:57] half of his postseason contests
[04:00] when he was younger he was more of an
[04:02] athletic force but
[04:03] still fairly raw since he picked up
[04:06] basketball at such a late
[04:07] age and by 1990 his defensive techniques
[04:11] were more polished
[04:12] and he still had that whirlwind
[04:14] athleticism
[04:15] but his 1993 season blended some
[04:18] sage tricks with his incredible body
[04:20] control that was so rare in someone his
[04:23] size for example hakeem learned to
[04:26] lurk closer to the ball than most big
[04:28] men of the illegal defense era
[04:30] you see joe klein point here because
[04:33] elijah won should be above the foul line
[04:35] but dream was so quick to the ball he
[04:37] was rarely called for these violations
[04:40] with david robinson at the top of the
[04:42] key akeem
[04:43] loads to the ball at the edge of the
[04:45] legal boundary the bottom of the little
[04:47] circle
[04:47] so his quick reaction time can erase a
[04:49] layup
[04:51] this subtle positioning was especially
[04:53] valuable on the weak side
[04:55] he's not glued to robinson and was
[04:57] always tracking the ball
[04:58] ready to materialize at the rim uh poor
[05:01] sean elliott
[05:03] elijah one's quick help was a nightmare
[05:05] for opponents
[05:06] who were reluctant to shoot when he went
[05:08] into fly swatting mode with that right
[05:10] hand
[05:11] he tracked threats well and was so quick
[05:14] to come into the lane and
[05:15] suffocate any attempt around the basket
[05:19] when akeem went to the bench opposing
[05:21] teams could finally
[05:22] breathe all of a sudden those high
[05:24] percentage shots around the hoop felt
[05:26] much
[05:26] easier back in the game he swarmed to
[05:30] the ball
[05:31] even with his man up high and that
[05:33] response speed
[05:34] generated more high leverage contests
[05:36] than any contemporary that i've tracked
[05:39] he didn't get to every threat he pounces
[05:42] on this back cut but it's a touch too
[05:44] late
[05:45] and every once in a while he missed a
[05:48] cutter coming through the lane
[05:50] but he was usually quick to rotate
[05:53] plugging up gaps in the back line
[05:56] although by 1995 he was a bit slower
[05:58] sometimes arriving
[06:00] late on these save attempts from outside
[06:01] the paint and
[06:03] a slightly slower motor meant he wasn't
[06:05] itching to jump
[06:06] at everything on command
[06:09] hakeem's agility helped him defend the
[06:11] perimeter too
[06:12] for one he was rarely ever attacked by
[06:15] wings on
[06:16] switches they also didn't run as many
[06:19] pick and rolls in the 90s as they do
[06:20] today
[06:21] and coverages weren't as developed then
[06:24] yet
[06:24] he was still comfortable stepping out
[06:27] and taking on smaller players in these
[06:28] spots without too much of a price to pay
[06:32] on this 1993 play hakeem realizes
[06:35] there's too much space between him and
[06:37] the ball
[06:37] so he closes it quickly then sort of
[06:40] lingers near the lane so he can blow up
[06:42] another shot attempt
[06:45] here he blitzes the ball handler to
[06:47] completely blow up the play
[06:49] although maybe he's too overzealous
[06:51] hounding the dribbler into the backcourt
[06:54] still this fantastic mobility allowed
[06:57] him to erase weaknesses
[06:59] in these outdated ball screen coverages
[07:01] he's really low and lunges at the ball
[07:03] from this
[07:04] crouch then somehow slides back to
[07:07] contest
[07:09] he's hugged up to shaq on this pick and
[07:11] roll but that fluid footwork
[07:13] shifts him into position so he can
[07:15] seamlessly transition from sliding to
[07:17] jumping and preternatural timing stamps
[07:20] the layup
[07:22] the culmination of olajuwon's volleyball
[07:24] timing
[07:25] soccer agility and handball accuracy led
[07:28] to the most
[07:28] important block of his career this jon
[07:31] stark shot is for the title
[07:33] in 1994 hakeem slams on the brakes
[07:36] then somehow recovers backwards and
[07:38] times this leap off the wrong
[07:40] foot to save the season
[07:44] this matrix recovery looks half
[07:46] impossible but he does somehow block it
[07:49] to
[07:49] force a seventh game that houston would
[07:51] go on to win in large part
[07:53] because of olajuwon's offense which may
[07:57] have been even
[07:58] more gravity bending than his defense
[08:04] i remember one time i gave him a bow and
[08:06] he just laughed
[08:07] nice nice nice elbow brother and then he
[08:09] came out and gave me and
[08:12] by shaq means the dream shake
[08:15] hakeem's twirling array of head fakes
[08:17] and spins that set up so many of his
[08:19] moves
[08:20] his blend of size and balletic footwork
[08:23] made him a deadly isolation weapon
[08:25] and these were skills he possessed early
[08:27] in his career
[08:28] drilling crazy fadeaway jumpers or
[08:31] faking one way to freeze defenders and
[08:33] then spinning for a jump hook
[08:35] that agility and balance gave him an
[08:38] edge over most bigs of that time
[08:41] but shot selection was an issue in those
[08:43] early days
[08:44] launching into triple teams at times and
[08:47] in other cases just
[08:48] firing deep jumpers early in the shock
[08:50] clock
[08:52] by 1993 hakeem's scoring game was more
[08:55] polished and
[08:56] under control carving out shots like
[08:58] some sort of basketball ballerina
[09:01] all of his moves flowed together which
[09:04] made them so difficult to slow down
[09:06] a spin one way then back the other
[09:09] throwing up fake and then a hook
[09:11] from there he could fake the hook to set
[09:13] up his fade away to the opposite
[09:14] shoulder
[09:16] and at around 250 pounds he was able to
[09:18] pivot with power
[09:20] and find clean shots in traffic
[09:23] even double teams couldn't always stop
[09:25] his fade away
[09:26] because he could twist and contort into
[09:28] the shot comfortably
[09:30] and dream could also face up from the
[09:32] perimeter and
[09:33] wheel his way into those michael jordan
[09:35] once called him a seven foot guard
[09:37] because hakeem's handle was secure
[09:39] enough to drive into open space
[09:42] and that quickness was a challenge for
[09:44] most opponents
[09:45] who worked really hard just to keep up
[09:47] only to be juked right into
[09:49] highlightville
[09:51] after all of that big men still had to
[09:53] worry about his
[09:54] spin oh that is so nasty
[09:58] hakeem's array of pirouettes and
[10:01] dizzying pump fakes crescendoed in the
[10:03] 1995 western finals against david
[10:05] robinson
[10:06] who was often left on an island to
[10:08] defend him inviting akeem to shoot into
[10:11] that single coverage
[10:13] this series wasn't actually that
[10:15] different from olajuwon's normal scoring
[10:17] these years
[10:18] there were a number of those savage fade
[10:20] aways
[10:22] some of which were still really
[10:23] difficult and didn't always go in
[10:26] along with an assortment of drives up
[10:28] fakes spins and hook
[10:30] shots a lack of double teams made life
[10:32] easier for akeem
[10:33] who obviously welcomed the chance to
[10:35] dance with robinson
[10:37] in an isolation game alajawan is one of
[10:40] the few players who improved his scoring
[10:43] numbers in the playoffs
[10:44] and from 1993 to 95 he was just behind
[10:47] the all-time scoring juggernauts in
[10:49] volume while scoring on positive
[10:51] efficiency
[10:52] as a primary scorer he compares
[10:54] favorably to
[10:55] other contemporary big men however the
[10:59] brilliance of akeem shot making was a
[11:01] double-edged sword
[11:02] these moves were difficult for defenses
[11:04] to take away without hard double teams
[11:07] but they also were hard shots to make
[11:10] most players manufacture easy points
[11:12] against weak defenses
[11:14] but are forced into harder low
[11:16] percentage shots against elite ones
[11:18] but akeem's attempts were already
[11:20] difficult in the first place
[11:22] he just made a bunch of them and since
[11:25] he could generate these shots
[11:26] almost on demand stronger defenses
[11:29] couldn't really
[11:30] take away his scoring because he was
[11:32] already taking those hard shots
[11:35] this kind of resilient or inelastic
[11:38] scoring
[11:38] meant elijahuan's numbers weren't dented
[11:41] that much when he
[11:42] faced stiffer defenses compared to other
[11:44] players in this series
[11:46] elijahuan shows some of the smallest
[11:48] change among volume scorers
[11:50] when facing high-end defensive teams
[11:52] versus facing
[11:54] weak defensive teams one way to
[11:57] limit hakeem's scoring was by sending
[11:59] effective help that
[12:00] forced him into a pass he was dangerous
[12:04] enough that defenses frequently doubled
[12:06] him
[12:06] and that created plenty of outside shots
[12:08] for teammates but elijah won was
[12:11] not a natural passer his instinct was to
[12:14] catch and immediately shift into a
[12:15] scoring move
[12:16] which is why he jacked up so many wild
[12:18] shots when he was younger
[12:20] in 1993 hakeem said he finally grew
[12:23] comfortable
[12:24] trusting his teammates to knock down
[12:25] their open shots and coach rudy
[12:27] tomjanovich implemented a more elashawon
[12:30] centric
[12:30] offense with shooters around hakeem in a
[12:33] kind of spoken wheel model
[12:36] he was more patient in spots allowing
[12:38] the defense to commit to a double team
[12:40] before making a decision
[12:42] and this substantially helped his
[12:43] playmaking during these years by
[12:44] punishing defenses
[12:46] with some basic passing instead of his
[12:48] own scoring
[12:50] his balance and body control allowed him
[12:53] to flow from his scoring dance steps
[12:55] into passes if he felt too much pressure
[12:58] this is a stark contrast to robinson in
[13:01] the last episode
[13:02] who could get locked up by hard doubles
[13:05] hakeem on the other hand easily segued
[13:07] from a dream shake
[13:08] to a pass this helps replace some
[13:11] difficult shots with passes
[13:13] he misses a teammate in close but at
[13:15] least finds the open shooter
[13:17] and here he feels the double misses a
[13:20] more advanced interior pass but still
[13:22] calmly kicks it to a teammate
[13:25] now even in those years olajuwon still
[13:28] took his fair share of double team shots
[13:30] where he left shooters stranded his
[13:32] instinct to just catch
[13:34] and immediately look to score was still
[13:36] strong even at his peak
[13:37] but i think a bigger weakness was a lack
[13:40] of vision
[13:41] this looks like it's in his periphery
[13:43] but he misses it
[13:45] and he rarely ever hit these kinds of
[13:47] passes it's still there when he shoots
[13:50] some of this was a byproduct of playing
[13:52] with his back to the basket
[13:54] and not turning and surveying the court
[13:56] but elijah wasn't someone who
[13:58] mapped the floor or kept an eye on
[14:00] advantages like this
[14:02] his primary focus was reading the double
[14:04] team and here he spins away from it and
[14:06] loses track of where his teammates are
[14:10] to be fair he could hit passes if he
[14:13] felt an extra defender on a drive
[14:15] and he certainly had the athletic
[14:17] dexterity to drop dimes in those
[14:19] situations
[14:21] still more of his passing was out of the
[14:24] post
[14:24] and the results from there were
[14:26] certainly mixed maximizing akim's
[14:28] playmaking
[14:29] really required shooters who were spaced
[14:32] around the three-point arc
[14:33] and this likely raised his offensive
[14:35] value in 1995
[14:37] when the nba shortened the three-point
[14:39] line
[14:40] higher percentage shooters amplified
[14:42] akeem's playmaking
[14:43] by charging more for those double teams
[14:45] in the post
[14:47] in 1995 the rockets set a new nba record
[14:50] for threes in a season
[14:52] making nearly eight per game at 37
[14:54] percent
[14:55] then in the playoffs they were closer to
[14:58] nine threes per game at a hefty 39
[15:01] the record they broke was held by the
[15:04] 1994 rockets
[15:06] who made five a game in the regular
[15:07] season and then nearly seven
[15:09] at 36 percent in the playoffs and you'll
[15:12] never guess who held the playoff record
[15:14] before that
[15:15] the 1993 rockets they made five per game
[15:19] at 37 percent
[15:22] some of those playoff percentages might
[15:24] be boosted by hot shooting
[15:26] but playing inside out was clearly the
[15:28] viable way to construct an offense
[15:31] around olajuwon and the results were
[15:33] pretty good but not great
[15:36] the shortened line in 1995 made this a
[15:39] more attainable
[15:40] strategy basically doubling the number
[15:42] of legit
[15:43] 35 three-point shooters in the league
[15:45] overnight
[15:46] but houston's offense wasn't great
[15:48] because of akeem's passing limitations
[15:50] he didn't look for extra passes like
[15:52] this naturally and so it's unclear how
[15:55] he would fit
[15:56] next to another offensive star the other
[15:59] tools were there
[16:00] to fit next to a playmaking perimeter
[16:02] weapon
[16:03] first he was a really solid mid-range
[16:05] shooter and that allowed him to play the
[16:07] pick and
[16:08] pop game effectively dream was nimble
[16:11] enough to move into some of these shots
[16:14] and the data we have on his long twos
[16:16] near the end of his career
[16:18] suggests he was fairly efficient from
[16:20] the outside he wasn't as big and
[16:23] explosive as someone like robinson
[16:25] either as a lob threat or headed
[16:27] downhill
[16:28] but his agility made him a strong
[16:30] finisher and this meant he was always a
[16:32] scoring threat as a role man
[16:34] using his gracefulness to carve out
[16:36] finishes near the rim
[16:39] furthermore hakeem was also a fantastic
[16:41] offensive rebounder
[16:43] some of this is related to his shot
[16:45] blocking where he could move and
[16:47] jump in one motion the other part is
[16:49] that he just
[16:50] constantly pursued the ball on misses
[16:53] and all those jukes and shakes along
[16:56] with his physical strength
[16:58] made him a pain to keep off the
[17:00] offensive glass
[17:02] he was particularly dangerous sneaking
[17:04] in from the perimeter
[17:05] swimming past two players here to steal
[17:08] shaq's board
[17:10] so the building blocks were certainly
[17:12] there for alajuan to play a fairly
[17:14] effective off-ball
[17:16] role it's just a question of how many
[17:18] post touches and hero ball shots he was
[17:20] willing to forgo
[17:22] his defensive prowess alone makes him
[17:24] interesting to build around
[17:26] because in theory he guarantees his team
[17:28] a passable defense
[17:30] and with the right pieces he can anchor
[17:32] an elite one
[17:33] before hakeem's defense started to slide
[17:35] in 1995
[17:37] those first two tomjanovich teams held
[17:39] opponents about four points below their
[17:41] regular season efficiency
[17:42] in the playoffs that's around the 70th
[17:45] percentile historically
[17:47] which is impressive for not fielding a
[17:49] defensively slanted team
[17:51] like detroit's bad boys or the twin
[17:53] tower spurs
[17:55] some of this impacts stem from mckeem's
[17:57] man to man defense
[17:58] his shot blocking instincts made
[18:00] shooting around him tricky
[18:02] while his agile feet kept quicker big
[18:04] men in front of him
[18:06] his balance and timing gave post players
[18:09] a ton of trouble
[18:10] which stood out in the 1994 finals
[18:13] against patrick
[18:14] ewing ewing struggled to find any clean
[18:17] shots when isolated against olajuwon
[18:19] and ended up posting an unheard of 39
[18:22] true shooting in that seven game series
[18:26] hakeem had incredible hands too probably
[18:28] from
[18:29] the handball and one of his defensive
[18:31] tricks when guarding the post was to
[18:33] time up a quick push flick once his man
[18:35] started dribbling
[18:37] sometimes just getting the ball to the
[18:39] post was a chore against him
[18:41] because he gobbled entry passes better
[18:43] than
[18:44] just about any center ever he was
[18:47] constantly repositioning himself
[18:49] into a slight overplay to take away the
[18:51] passing angle
[18:52] then quick enough to toggle back to the
[18:54] other side in a bait and switch
[18:57] all of his handsiness produced
[18:59] historically great steel rates
[19:01] among big men he posted eight of the top
[19:04] 100 seasons in steals per possession
[19:07] including the highest on record in 1989
[19:11] hakeem also borrowed a little bill
[19:13] russell move where he kept his left hand
[19:15] low to target passes
[19:17] when he left his feet back in episode 2
[19:21] we saw bill walton limit other all-star
[19:23] centers as
[19:24] scorers but akeem was even more
[19:26] impressive against all stars at his
[19:28] defensive peak
[19:29] he held them over 5 percentage points
[19:32] below their normal true shooting
[19:34] while denting their volume numbers match
[19:36] by only a few of the
[19:38] other defensive giants since we have
[19:41] plus minus data going back to 1994
[19:44] we can get an idea of how valuable all
[19:46] this defense
[19:47] was using that same hybrid metric from
[19:50] the last episode
[19:51] his impact looks great but it's short of
[19:54] the all-timers
[19:55] keep in mind though his 1993 numbers
[19:57] were likely even better
[19:59] and he seems to improve in the playoffs
[20:02] the box score numbers we do have for
[20:03] those post-seasons
[20:05] view him as around a top 15 peak
[20:08] and that's with limited information to
[20:10] capture his defensive worth
[20:12] given how much of houston's success was
[20:15] driven by a strong defense
[20:17] i think it's fair to assume much of
[20:19] olajuwon's impact was defensively driven
[20:22] which is hard for the box score to
[20:24] capture in a sense
[20:26] hakeem's isolation scoring and monster
[20:29] defense
[20:29] were functionally closer to a young will
[20:32] chamberlain
[20:33] players who can carry subpar offensive
[20:35] talent but who might not help good
[20:37] offenses as much
[20:39] hakeem's three-point shooting offenses
[20:41] did generate better results than those
[20:43] early will
[20:44] teams but i have some doubts about how
[20:47] he'd scale up
[20:48] next to another high-end talent given
[20:50] his passing limitations
[20:51] and shot selection on the other hand he
[20:54] did have the tools to add off-ball value
[20:57] as a rebounder and pick and roll partner
[20:59] while providing an inside out option for
[21:02] any offense
[21:03] and his prodigious defensive timing
[21:05] mobility
[21:06] and aggressiveness made him arguably the
[21:09] best defensive player
[21:11] of the three-point era and at his apex
[21:16] one of the very best big men of all time

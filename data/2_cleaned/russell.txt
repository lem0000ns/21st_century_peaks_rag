lebron james is the greatest player i

don't ever want to hear

anybody tell me that he is number one

michael george is number two

the greatest of all time the goat debate

it dominates the conversation today but

the original goat debate captivated

basketball back in the 1960s

back then the hoops world was divided

into two camps

one side argued for will chamberlain

based on his outlying statistical

achievements

and the other for bill russell who

collected an astounding 11

championship rings but what if that

whole paradigm is

backwards what if we threw russell's

rings out the window

used wilt stats against him and made the

statistical case

for russell over chamber

where's larry bird in all this

this series tackles one question who was

the best

at his best we start at the aba merger

and go through the best

multi-year stretches examining the

legends who provided the most on-court

impact these are the greatest

peaks

before we dive into specific years and

criteria we'll do that at the end of

this episode

wilt and russell illustrate something at

the heart of this series and basketball

itself

in 1962 chamberlain famously averaged 50

points and 25 rebounds per game

while playing every minute of every game

many consider it to be

the most dominant season in nba history

i don't think it's one of the hundred

best seasons

that may sound crazy but those 50 points

came with a

lot of caveats for one there were way

more scoring chances back in 1962

teams ran up and down to the tune of

about 130 possessions per game

that's about 30 more chances to rack up

stats than in a typical game today

more shots more free throws rebounds and

so on we examined this stat inflation

last year

but the takeaway here is that 50 points

per game then

isn't what we'd think of as 50 points

per game in the three-point era

maybe the easiest way to see this is to

note that wilt scored about

40 percent of his team's points that

season while he was on the court

whereas michael jordan and kobe bryant

scored about 43 percent of their team's

points

when on the court during their mega

scoring seasons

wilt also played the entire game which

gave him a few extra minutes of impact

but also made his rate of scoring less

impressive

the dipper scored about 29 points every

75 possessions he played that year

which would rank seventh this season so

a huge number but not a historical

outlier okay but so what you might say

even with stat inflation wilt still

crushed russell as a scorer

right and he did russell's scoring rate

was actually below league average for

most of his career

but the question here isn't who scored

more points per game

it's how much did these players help

their teams score more efficiently

playmaking is the other enormous driver

of offensive impact

making life easier for all four of your

teammates not just yourself

and will chamberlain was the original

black hole

it wasn't that he couldn't pass or that

he never set up his running mates

it's that he very rarely set them up

relative to how much he shot

if we look at true shot attempts that is

when a player took a field goal or

attempted two free throws

and compare those scoring attempts to

assists

we can see just how little wilt was play

making

here are all the non-chamberlain seasons

since the shot clock with at least 20

true shot attempts per 75 possessions

now here's wilt in the first half of his

career

he scored more while passing less than

just about anyone

ever and that was a criticism of him at

the time

it was common to hear refrains like this

from sports illustrated in 1966.

but the tactical demands of using wilt

to his best advantage

that's scoring by the way severely

diminish his team's own versatility

and generally create more out problems

among those who want the ball as much as

he does

now let's go back to that graph and add

his 50-point season

it is an outlier among

outliers this has been hiding in plain

sight for

60 years and the names of those who have

even gone over

15 to 1 should drive home just how

one-dimensional his offense was

the only players to cross that threshold

in the last decade

were brooke lopez in brooklyn and

kristaps porzingis in 2018

the takeaway here is that wilt's sexy

scoring numbers

were mostly one-dimensional and there's

only so much you can help your team

without making life easier for teammates

because of that nba axiom chamberlain's

team's offenses weren't very good during

those volume scoring seasons

they were most efficient in 1962 scoring

about two points more per hundred than

league average

but every other season they were around

average with chamberlain registering

huge numbers in 1965

his team had the worst offense in the

league by a mile before he was traded

and wilt averaged 39 points per game

on solid efficiency that year this

pattern has actually held throughout nba

history

huge volume scoring doesn't guarantee a

good offense

it can help lift teams to competitive

levels

raising their floor if you will but

there are endless combinations of talent

that can make an nba offense slightly

below

average besides dumping it into an

isolation score

40 of the time in 1965

wilt was traded to the philadelphia

76ers for their

fifth and eighth man and philadelphia

improved from around 500 play

to about a 48 win pace we don't know how

much of this improvement was a much

needed defensive boost

but again big scoring alone didn't

create a good

offense wilt's team offenses actually

improved when he finally

shot less way less actually

few players in nba history have

downshifted so

severely as a scorer going from a

shooting machine to leading the nba in

assists

in his second full season with the 76ers

wilt's scoring rate dropped almost down

to

russell levels and his team's offense

exploded

there's an enormous negative correlation

between chamberlain's scoring rates

and his team's offensive success the

less he shot

the better they did that doesn't mean

his volume shooting

hurt his team but it does suggest that

it was holding back his better teammates

otherwise why did his coach completely

change his style

with better players around him russell

on the other hand was never seen as an

offensive force

but instead is the benefactor of great

teammates

koozie and heinzen at first then sam

jones and john havlicek

but there's an enormous problem with

that idea

if there's one thing that hasn't changed

in the nba over the years

it's that most all-star players are

recognized for their

offense this includes those celtics

around bill russell and it's often said

that his bandmates made boston

a dynasty but the celtics weren't

actually overflowing with all-star

talent then

here are the all-star appearances by

team during boston's perfect run from

to 1959-1966 excluding russell and wilt

does any club jump out as being

completely stacked with all-stars if

wilt or russell were to join them

if anything the lakers behind jerry west

and elgin baylor

two of the five best players of the

period themselves look like the most

top-heavy team if we add russell to the

celtics

they end up with the most all-stars but

wilt's teams weren't lagging

far behind so a bunch of franchises had

two or three all-star players typically

based on offensive play

and since russell's supporting cast was

no different it should come as no

surprise that boston's offense was

around average or even below average for

most of the 1960s

instead those celtics teams won with

defense

during russell's time in boston he

spearheaded the greatest defensive

dynasty the league has ever seen

strangling opponents night after night

with a timeless combination of size

speed mobility and awareness boston

ultimately incorporated solid defensive

teammates to platoon around big bill

but he was the driving force behind a

club that allowed the fewest points per

possession in the league

in 11 of his 13 seasons and while most

of the nba was struggling to reach 50

wins at the time due to parody

russell's celtics were an outlier

cranking out 60 win seasons

these circles represent every team's

defensive efficiency relative to the

league

since 1955. the year before russell

arrived

boston had the worst defense in the

league statistically giving up an

estimated

3 points more than lee average with

russell they jumped to the top of the

league

and would steadily improve as 1950s

names faded

and were replaced by stronger and more

athletic defenders in 1961.

at their peak in 1964 boston was nearly

10 points better per 100 than other

teams on that end

arguably the greatest defensive season

ever

as russell aged and the nba expanded

boston remained competitive with its

defense

until he retired at 35 and then

immediately fell

back to the pack all told russell

captained

5 of the 25 best defensive seasons in

league history

in a row an unrivaled team

accomplishment

without a three-point line and primitive

spacing that allowed big men to patrol

the paint

as a backstop a versatile vertical

defender

like russell became the game's most

valuable weapon

boston's ascension to record-setting

defense coincided with russell playing

more minutes

with a platoon of players around him at

their apex no other celtic logged more

than 33 minutes per night

and boston's final resurgence in 1969

came with russell re-upping his minutes

alongside boston's best offensive player

at the time john havelchek many people

talk about

wilt dominating russell heads up because

he scored more than bill

in their 142 meetings on record

chamberlain averaged over 28 points per

game on 51

true shooting compared to just 14 points

per game on 42 percent true shooting for

russ

but russell's primary value didn't come

from his scoring

he won five mvps because he made scoring

harder

for the opposition and chamberlain was

no exception

against everyone else wilt averaged 34

points per game

on 54 true shooting so russell gave him

a

major haircut denting his scoring and

efficiency

you might think sure but wilt's numbers

are still great

but remember his scoring didn't make his

team's offense very potent in the first

place

so russell was blunting what was only a

moderately sharp weapon to begin with

imparting that massive defensive impact

that drove boston to title after title

every spring

and when chamberlain was going hog wild

trying to score in 1962

russell gave him a larger haircut in

these 75

games wilt didn't face bill he averaged

51 points per night

on 54 true shooting against russell

he averaged 37 points per game

on 50 true shooting that would rank 11th

this year

in permanent scoring similar to paul

george in volume and efficiency

if there were stats like opponent field

goal percentage in the paint

or how much did you hold players below

their average

pundits might have viewed russell's

performances against wilt as being

dominant

but those stats didn't exist so

russell's continued success

forced people then to search for

explanations beyond scoring

some people like to credit his

intangibles as a leader

and others are more dismissive looking

to his teammates as the reason for their

success

we don't have precise measuring tools

for that period

but if we look at the 28 games russell

missed between 1958 and 1969

the celtics played at a 35 win pace

without him

and a 59 win pace when he played that's

super duper impact especially compared

to the changes we saw when

wilt shifted teams but remember these

are crude measuring tools

another more comprehensive approach is

to also account for teammates who have

gone in and out of the lineup over the

years

by looking at how his teammates impacted

teams when they were in and out of the

lineup

and so on and so forth we did something

just like this in part five of the

thinking basketball stats series

and when we solve this giant equation

to estimate a player's overall value

looking at just the final score and who

played in the game

russell comes out ahead of wilt

this is a noisy calculation it's

possible that in reality

these players could be worth a few

points more or a few points less per

game than these studies conclude

but consider how amazing this is the

only thing this metric uses

is who played and what the score was and

yet

its top 25 players claimed three

quarters of the available mvps

and averaged 13 all-star appearances

per player and again it says that when

we ignore the box score

and focus on the relationship between

the scoreboard and the player

that bill russell is actually better

than will chamberlain

that's incredible to me even if it's not

a definitive proof

and all of this has significant

ramifications for the idea of number one

options we typically think about them as

the best offensive player on a team

but a great defender like russell can be

the best player on his team by

far without being the best or even

second best offensive player

this was often the norm before the aba

nba merger in 1977

and while it's rare today because rule

changes have helped elite offensive

players

while chipping away at elite defensive

impact tim duncan's spurs

kevin garnett's celtics and arguably ben

wallace's pistons

are examples of recent teams where the

best overall player

wasn't head and shoulders the best

offensive player

if we return to those impact studies

that looked at who played

and what the score was we see something

fascinating

among the top 20 players a handful are

primarily playmakers

a handful are primarily scorers who are

also plentiful playmakers

and another handful are defensive titans

what's so telling to me is that this

metric isn't influenced by any of our

ideas of

scoring first and second options or even

defense

and yet it's littered with at least four

completely different types of players

if we use modern play-by-play data to

generate a more stable look at this kind

of scoreboard only impact again we'd see

the exact same results hold

it's a player's overall impact that

matters in basketball

and that comes in so many different

combinations

in many ways wilt and russell are the

original example of this

philosophical loggerheads with

chamberlain bringing

offensive and defensive impact and

russell trying to outpace him

mostly with his giant defensive value

isolation scoring like

chamberlain's can be impressive to watch

and helpful for teams starved of scoring

threats

but it can also prevent other offensive

talents from flourishing

in the absence of playmaking that means

i'll be working off the following

criteria for this

series first this series is about

basketball impact on the court we'll

contextualize circumstances and

philosophies

but factors like aesthetic appeal aren't

outside of the scope here

second i care about someone's overall

impact

specifically how much they can help a

team win championships

that means skills that scale up to

better teams

tend to matter more than skills that

can't mesh with other

top flight players third were starting

in 1977

when the leagues merged while the game

continues to evolve

the size of the league and its

competitiveness are similar since the

merger

making for fair comparisons which will

be made

relative to the league in a given year

there are no time machines here

instead we're trying to understand how

much a player

impacted the game given the rules and

practices of that

time and finally those peaks must

contain

multiple consecutive seasons the key

reason for this approach is to avoid

fluky single season outcomes and to

increase the breadth of information to

evaluate a player

at the end of this series we'll revisit

how all these guys stack up

but otherwise the episodes will flow

roughly in chronological order

profiling the greatest peaks in nba

history if you're interested in

isolation scoring in greater detail

and specifically wilts it's a main theme

in thinking basketball the book

and chronicled in the back picks top 40

series russell and chamberlain would

certainly be featured in a great peak

series that went back to the shot clock

along with the 260s megastars oscar

robertson and jerry west

but due to a lack of footage and data

they're difficult to compare on even

ground

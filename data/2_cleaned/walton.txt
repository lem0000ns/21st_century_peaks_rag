there's a mythology about bill walton

that few players can match

blazer mania that fiery mountain man

beard

and countless injuries that ended his

prime as soon as it began

his first two seasons were shortened by

an assortment of ailments before

a brief two-year stretch in 1977 and

1978

that yielded an nba championship and an

mvp trophy

so just how good were those two seasons

was that brief peak enough to compete

with the most dominant centers in nba

history

and was he the greatest passing big man

of all time

larry bird in all this has it blocked by

elijah

michael jordan saves the day this series

tackles

one question who was the best at his

best

we started the aba merger and go through

the best multi-year stretches

examining the legends who provided the

most on-court impact

these are the greatest peaks

before we can estimate walton's impact

it's important to

understand the way the game was played

before the three-point line

with so many shots funneled into the

paint and no extra point for stretching

out the court

defensive big men were titans back then

the definitive basketball archetype

wasn't a high-flying scoring guard but a

dominant

center and no not wilt chamberlain but

his rival bill russell

russell's defensive genius reigned over

the prior decade

where he won five mvps without being a

heavy scorer on

offense that's worth repeating will

chamberlain once

averaged 50 points per game in a season

but the zeitgeist of the time was

to play like russell in 1967

after years of volume scoring

chamberlain's own coach asked him to

play like russell

shoot less pass more protect the paint

and this led to a new record for wins

and an

end to the celtics eight consecutive

title streak

the search for the next russell peaked

in 1969

when a rookie wes unseld won the mvp by

playing a

team-centric pass rebound and defend

role that russell was glorified for

playing

and that's exactly how walton played

only with greater scoring skill

than either unseld or russell as a

sophomore in college

he was compared to both rust and

chamberlain

and is a junior authored arguably the

greatest single game performance

in ncaa history going 21 of

22 from the floor in route to 44 points

and his 60th win in 60 college games up

until that point

not too shabby the grainy signs of his

offensive repertoire were on display

the bank shot his activity dexterity and

of course

the passing like most players walton

probably peaked as a passer later in his

career

especially with slightly more space to

work with in the 1980s

back in 77 and 78 at the height of his

overall powers

his passing was defined by hitting

swirling cutters from the mid and high

post

area some of these were like water polo

passes just

flipping the ball over heads in really

tight quarters

but the defining characteristic of these

passes was speed

and accuracy older centers could

occasionally throw

flashier passes than walton from these

cornerstone

spots but walton's volume and efficiency

was

unmatched until that point in time note

his little hop

to create a better delivery angle over

the top portland's

half court game was largely built off

cutters buzzing around walton like this

he has multiple options here if there's

any opening

and his speed accuracy combination

resembles a modern quarterback

throwing tight short yardage completions

today we might just see a crowded lane

where everyone's covered but

walton sees a pass behind the hoop the

only window to thread this needle

through

compare that to another blazer big lloyd

neal

who misses a walton special here only to

have big red

show him how it's done walton's vision

stems from reading the game so well at

the team

level knowing who's supposed to go where

and what options are available

with the overplay on the pass he leads

the cutter into space

and again what accuracy on the release

walton's also known for his outlet

passing and he mostly flung these toward

the mid court after

ripping down a rebound it was almost

like a single motion

grabbing and firing to start portland's

vaunted fast break

but he wasn't throwing touchdowns on

these like some of the other great

outlet passers of that era already were

and in the limited game footage in

public the one he tried got away from

him a bit

his more notable weakness to me is

passing on the move

his handle wasn't really functional and

that meant that his half-court passing

was

largely stationary limited to whatever

outpost he caught the ball from

of course most big men at the time

couldn't pass on the move

nor was the game conducive to them

running pick and roll

so relative to his time walton was

certainly among the best passing bigs to

come along

and perhaps the best ever at finding

cutters

all of walton's missed games from injury

give us insight into his value for

portland

in games where walton was the only

missing rotational player

portland assisted on 54 of its field

goals

in 1977 and 1978. add walton in and that

number

jumped to nearly 58 his outlet passing

had a similar effect on

pace with walton the blazers played at a

slightly above average pace for the time

and without him they averaged four fewer

possessions a game

which would have made them one of the

slower teams in the league

the total effect on offense was that the

blazers were 3.7 points better than

average with him

but only 1.2 points better without him

that is still a solid offense without

big bill largely because his

replacements were good scores tom owens

averaged 19 points per game and four

assists in 1979

and the aforementioned lloyd neal was a

good scorer too

walton was a similar scorer to those two

at least statistically

going to that jump hook as a bread and

butter move

he had nice touch on this and while it

certainly wasn't the sky hook

that's for the next episode bill could

release this cleanly most of the time

without too much of a setup

it was a back to the basket move but it

was also used at the end of a little

face up like this when headed right

he could also knock down mid-range

jumpers preferring to go glass on these

whenever possible

big red could walk into these but also

liked a turn around after a single

dribble

his range on these jumpers was maybe out

to 17 or 18 feet

probably limited by that funky form that

kept his free throw shooting around 70

percent

at his peak his scoring moves were

decisive like this but he didn't possess

an overwhelming scoring arsenal

adjusted for inflation to 2020 numbers

walden averaged about

20 to 21 points per 75 possessions

during this two-year peak and his

scoring efficiency was four to five

percentage points ahead of the league

interestingly his scoring did slide a

touch in his 19 playoff games

averaging closer to 17 points per 75

when adjusting for inflation

with slightly lower efficiency than in

the regular season

during that 77 playoff run walton was

the second leading scorer on the team

but

only the fourth leading scorer when

adjusting for pace

a testament to portland's balanced

attack built off of walton's passing

but the blazers weren't a dominant

playoff offense

in part because of bill's shortcoming as

a scorer

he also added value with his activity

first as a cutter

knowing when to read this opening for a

dive cut and lob

this kind of off-ball play adds value

around higher end talent

and it led to this vintage blazer mania

sequence in the 1977 finals against

philadelphia

walton was always looking for little

soft spots in the defense

finding offensive rebounding

opportunities and high percentage second

chance points

that cleaned up for his teammates he

wasn't a

skywalker but his size and quick leaping

allowed him to finish plays around the

rim

and score off of rebounds like this

boosting his scoring numbers a bit in

the process

with these high percentage follow-ups by

the way

walton was huge his height is debated

but

he wasn't much smaller than kareem

abdul-jabbar who stood 7-2 without

shoes and here he is next to robert

parish

listed at 7-1 and kevin mchale listed at

6

10. that size contributed to his

crippling injuries

as his feet weren't anatomically capable

of supporting his big frame

and the shock of all that running and

jumping

walton missed three full seasons before

ramping his career back up in 1983 in

san diego

again he's not dwarfed by kareem here at

all but

boy did that size and mobility help him

protect the paint

walton's massive impact on the game his

very inclusion in this series

is primarily because of his defensive

value

value created with his length awareness

and motor

most seven footers aren't super active

and able to read the game but back

before the three-point line this was

arguably the most

valuable trait in the entire

sport we'll see why in a moment

filming birds of prey is not for those

who have a fear of heights i graduated

from the practice tree to the 200-foot

monster

to bring her up beautiful to fly and

hold the eagle was a landmark of my life

was a classic paint protector and

because of the rules back then

he almost served like a goaltender

patrolling the area in front of the hoop

and challenging all comers the dangerous

doug

collins runs into a wall here or or i

guess a

wall tin there's a good joke in there

somewhere

but bill was always really well

positioned he

sagged off players without the ball in

textbook fashion but was ready to pounce

in these spots

he was one of the most active big

defenders in league history

helping when needed or stepping out in

challenging shots in the mid range

ambushing pete maravich here who thought

he was in the clear

you'll notice his hands are always out

clogging passing lanes so teams don't

sneak those dimes through to cutters

like the blazers did

and his hands were active targeting the

ball here deflecting this jump pass

like great rim protectors he was

accurate jabbing at the basketball

and he would pull his hand away to avoid

fouling at times

bill's quick bunny hop couldn't get him

over the top of the square like some of

the great modern

shot blockers and this meant that

occasionally strong athletes or crafty

finishers

could slip one through here he slides

down in position

but miss times his jump and that throws

off the contest a bit

but his typical reactions were quick and

with

sound position he bothered so many shots

he wasn't a stiff either comfortably

chasing wings outside the paint

to harass their jumpers remember back

then biggs couldn't really be exposed on

an island against quicker players

because they didn't have to chase out to

the three-point line

the game in those days was built more

around the post-up with

offenses running through the center

unlike walton most high end big men were

looking to score

more than pass and that created even

more defensive responsibility

for the bigs of that era in the 1977

western conference finals

walton famously battled cream of

duljabar for four games

trying his best to sit on kareem's

lethal skyhook

and force him left with mixed results

that's better than most against jabbar

and walton's size

and acumen helped slow kareem a bit

compared to normal centers

here he tracks him well without the ball

happily forcing jabar left

but sometimes there's no stopping kareem

walton

also stayed active working for better

defensive position

here leading to a steal and against more

mortal figures

his man defense was highly effective

banging and then going vertical against

daryl dawkins in the 77 finals

squint a bit and you'll see hall of

famer dan issel more of a shooting

center

get stuffed by walton on this jumper and

bill was always using his size and

positioning to defend opponents like

this

he was the original big fundamental

taking a textbook approach to activity

positioning

vertical contests and so on we can see

the effect his manned defense had on

opponents during this 1977 and 78

stretch

by looking at the 48 games he played

against other all-star

centers for instance kareem averaged

25.9 points per 36 minutes

on 61 true shooting against everyone

else

but in eight games against walton

averaged 24 and a half

on 57 true shooting if we do this for

the other seven all-star centers during

these years

only big bob lanier and another southpaw

dave cowans

avoid a pretty clear drop off against

walton

now team factors influence data like

this but numbers like these crystallize

the effect of a superstar defender

in total these all-stars scored nearly

two fewer points per 36

on four percent worse true shooting

against walton

an effect that compares favorably to all

but the all-time great

post defenders in many ways portland was

built around walton on both

ends their guards could be more

aggressive pressuring the ball with big

bill behind them

while portland didn't need another paint

protector out there to take away from

its speed and

skill game on offense if we go back to

those games walton missed

we can see how insanely valuable his

defense was

the blazers gave up about 103 points per

100

in the 26 games with just walton missing

but

only 95.6 with him in the lineup

a jump from the third worst defense in

the league to the very

best defense in the league this is

likely beyond the offensive impact of

any player in the first 30 years of the

league perhaps save for

oscar robertson or jerry west

overall the blazers were actually

outscored in those two seasons without

walton they had a negative adjusted

point differential

equivalent to a 37 win team but with him

they had a

plus eight and a half point differential

a 64 win pace

among players to miss at least 20 games

over a single or multi-year period

that nearly 10 point increase with

walton is the second largest in the

first

70 years of the nba and that came in an

era of parody

where winning 55 games was rare

only nate thurmond another defensive

stud was associated with a larger

increase

but his team was far worse than those

blazers who went a stunning 87 and 28 in

those games with big bill

and just 10 and 16 without him

again most of that value was defensive

so

fittingly it was the blazers defense

that shined in 19 playoff games

holding opponents nearly five and a half

points below their regular season

scoring efficiencies

in those two seasons walton and company

also played eight games without their

only other all-star

maurice lucas and in those eight games

the blazers went

8-n-o these indicators with players

moving in and out of the lineup

do still have some noise we can't say

for certain walton was worth nine and a

half points but

26 games is enough to know that he was

likely worth at least say

six points to those blazers and that's

an historically huge

number combine that with other factors

like lucas's miss time

the playoff performance and what we can

see on film and it's clear walton was

the linchpin of a budding dynasty

in 1979 with michael thompson clay's dad

replacing walton in the starting lineup

and some minor bench changes

the blazers reverted back to playing

just over 500 basketball

reinforcing bill's massive impact

i think it's fair to look at their team

construction and think that there isn't

another center

in league history who could have

maximized that fit

as well as the big redhead

our best impact metrics that reach back

in time view

walton as having say a top 40 peak in

playoff history

his two-year regular season numbers were

similar by the way and

these metrics respect his defense likely

reflecting how

excellent his fit in portland was but

even in a less optimal situation they

still suggest that he belongs in this

kind of conversation

and given how well his defense and his

passing

would travel to other teams i don't

think there are 10

centers in nba history who peaked higher

than bill walton

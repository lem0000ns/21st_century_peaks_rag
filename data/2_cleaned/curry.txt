traditional nba superstars have either been really really tall or really really

athletic every other player in this series is at least six foot five

except for this guy wardell stephen curry is rightfully considered the greatest

shooter in nba history but just how good can someone be with

outliers shooting how much did his lack of classic athleticism hold him back on

defense and was his radical offensive approach so game changing that it made him the most

valuable offensive player of all time

where's larry bird in all this has it blocked by elijah michael jordan saves the day this series

tackles one question who was the best at his best we start at the aba merger and go

through the best multi-year stretches examining the legends who provided the most on court impact

these are the greatest peaks

i liked it but i was more interested in basketball at the time so um it was more my sport kind of um

i had more uh i was kind of better at it it's basketball and i wanted to um practice

some more on it and um try to make it to the frozen chance the other offensive greats we've looked

at in this series found a way to pressure the rim while also getting to their sweet spots

kareem had his sky hook jordan had mid-range pull-ups but curry short-circuited the entire

system he didn't park himself in the most valuable spot like shaq and he didn't charge toward the basket

like lebron instead he turned the three-point line into his own personal layup

from 2016 to 19 curry made nearly 50 percent of his open threes that's the

equivalent of a 73 percent two-point shot efficiency that only incredible rim finishers can

generate but instead of being limited to the restricted area to produce this kind of

efficiency he could manufacture his long-range layups from all over the court curry became a

real life video game a custom player with 99 shooting who started spamming threes from 28 feet

away like there was a glitch in the matrix it was only slightly better for

defenders when they were a touch closer at four to six feet away he made 43 of his threes the equivalent of a

mere 65 percent from two point range other players have shot at comparable

percentages but curry set himself apart with the obscene volume at which he could

manufacture these attempts it starts with his release speed which is the quickest that espn sports science

has ever clocked around four tenths of a second on some of these shots

in less time than it takes to say basketball curry ends his dribble and has the shot

out of his hands so instead of using verticality to keep his shot away from defenders

he used speed so they can't close the distance horizontally

this is how he can get his shot off from all over the court even when guarded by bigger defenders

curry even has crazy release speed in catch-and-shoot situations taking around two-thirds of a second to

grab a pass and turn it into a shot and this could be even faster on perfect

passes because he tried to catch it while he was squared up to the basket ready to shoot by the way his dad

dell also had some lightning quick releases back in the 90s although at six foot two steph was even

shorter so his release speed was even more important another reason he's able to generate so

many of these quality threes is his range he's comfortable shooting his

normal shot out to at least 30 feet which means there are a few hundred square feet on the court where

an open steph curry 3 is highly efficient offense there have been scientific breakdowns of this as

well and the key to his long range accuracy is minimal knee bend which limits the

variability in his shot mechanics this creates a consistent energy transfer off the floor

where curry flexes his wrist harder at the end of the movement to control the distance giving him an

incredibly stable shot from well beyond the line another skill

that separated steph from so many great shooters was his handle his dribbling sets up so

many of these shots by helping him probe for superior shooting spots on the floor he had all the building

blocks of a great ball handler he loved little in and outs like this this one creates a ton of space

into the step back and it turns into free throws and he had the full arsenal of through

the legs behind the back crossovers or sharp crosses in front of his body to shake defenders

he likes to throw combinations a second behind the back bounce buckles kevin durant and leads to a

layup and this was more audacious an in and out into the behind the back in traffic and the sweet finish for an

and one see it works every time he blended hesitations with sharp hard

dribbles staying over his center of gravity to accelerate in any direction

steph didn't really lean much on these moves keeping weight in both feet for quick changes of direction

after his dribble which meant he could do this on the run right there and create a little opening from

deep to pull up from the threat of these pull-ups from anywhere

opened up his drives he looks at the hoop and brings that right hand toward the ball like he's going to shoot

which fakes out james harden and sets up penetration into the paint and sometimes he could lift

defenders off their feet by merely looking at the basket kevin love lunges at him which gets curry free

but again he can't finish it steph's small stature made finishing in traffic a tricky

endeavor he destroys gerald henderson but another wing sliding over alters his

shot this time he uses that fake step back by looking at the hoop

but he sees traffic in the lane and pulls up early which ends up in a rejection from behind

these little pull-ups could be an effective counter love crowds him so tightly he only needs

a first step and a soft banker from about eight feet does the trick curry wasn't

lightning quick but with defenders so far out worried about his shot he could get a step and once he turns

the corner here he picks it up for a long distance scoop most attackers take

an additional dribble in these spots to explode upwards but he couldn't win verticality contests

so he relied on ambidextrous touch these longer

higher arcing layups aren't quite as easy as taking it all the way to the cup but curry's outlier hand-eye

coordination helped him convert these kinds of finishes regularly when there wasn't a second defender that

handle let him attack guards and flip up little shots like this and

some of these were just incredible finishes making circus shots look like no big deal these could even work

against shot blockers a crossover into a shot fake that freezes the defender briefly

and sets up the huge teardrop off the glass this is similar to what we saw from

larry bird in episode 4 where creative adaptive skill

offsets a lack of verticality curry brings the ball far away from the defender

and his body and has the concentration to take one in the face and still finish since defenses couldn't

give steph any air space on ball screens big men often switched on to him so when

he was able to get a step he could use his body to protect himself from larger shot blockers this came in two forms

he could either angle back into the path of the defender or when a shot blocker was in pursuit he

could decelerate and create contact despite weighing around 190

pounds he could take it right at much bigger players sometimes and these moments where he embraced

physicality on hard drives not only helped him finish but gave him a respectable free throw rate

for someone who relied so much on shooting and ball skills curry's bag of tricks

made him a pretty good rim finisher and an especially good one for a point guard

tony parker is the historical gold standard among little guys but steph wasn't too far off in terms of

volume or efficiency sometimes he'd mix in mid-range shots

stopping on a dime on one of these drives but only about 10 percent of his offense came off of two pointers outside of 10

feet like this curry's style organically bypassed the mid-range because he was either hunting

for threes half of his offense came from downtown or driving by defenders who chased him

far away from the basket steph took three-point hunting to a new level

becoming more dangerous after passing it which brings us to the fourth and final reason

he generated so many great attempts his off-ball movement

many great shooters run around without the ball but curry took the art to a new level

his most notable contribution to the field was the relocation shot where he'd pass

it and then immediately run out to the three-point line for a catch and shoot triple

being so dangerous with a live dribble made so many of these possible he could attack off the bounce for a

pull-up or finish into traffic but steph passed it so we could just keep looking around

for higher percentage shots even without the ball remember big men often switched out onto

him and they weren't used to clinging to their marks after a pass and those brief lulls created more 24

foot layups for the human torch of course curry had all the classic off-ball routes too

curling off screens right into a bomb and he was a master at using picks walking defenders

right into his teammate and jutting out the other side for open looks when teams overplayed the top side to

take away the three he had incredible feel for slipping back door and then a minute later that back door

sets up a counter cut back out to the three-point line and that's just wrong

if you're interested in more curry cuts and the power of off-ball movement there's an entire video about it on this

channel in addition to having every off-ball move in the book steph just never stopped moving

which basically made him a threat to score all the time and because he ran around so much curry

was an all-time great endurance athlete training not just his lungs but his nervous system to be able to stroke

these shots on autopilot even with fatigued legs

despite this atypical approach all of this made him one of history's great scorers

and curry authored the greatest scoring regular season ever becoming the only player in the

three-point era to lead the league in scoring volume and in scoring efficiency of course the

possessions where curry wasn't scoring had an enormous effect as well

because steph required unique defensive attention that the league had never seen

bring home the bacon dead now you're cooking then smooth mixing after his record-setting

regular season in 2016 curry hit a rough patch in the playoffs quite

literally spraining his mcl he returned a few weeks later and while his numbers were still good

they were a step down from his blazing regular season performance the cavs wanted to be physical with

curry in the finals bumping him away from the ball whenever they had the chance with the intention of wearing him down

big men chipped him when he ran by and curry's man harassed him while nearly ignoring

the on ball action the goal was to take away steph's threes and force his teammates to make them

and these curry rules of physically face guarding him while a second defender

also put a body on him led to 11 fewer touches per game for steph

denting his scoring volume in the process when curry had the ball they jumped his

screens hard or simply trapped him so he was forced to give it up and this led to wide open

shots but steph's teammates shot a chilly 28 from downtown with him on the court

in the finals by the way other teams mimicked these tactics in the ensuing years

and curry responded by gaining some muscle to help absorb this kind of physical load

so that cleveland defense had an effect but steph also lost some of his rhythm and

lateral quickness by playing through pain and some stiffness after that injury and his normal ability

to punish big men on some of these switches was noticeably absent at times in that series

he wasn't sharp handling some of those cavalier traps throwing a few lazy passes and turnovers

were a problem for him in general even with fantastic ball

handling he could be a bit sloppy at times and his dribbling aggression came with some risks

whether this was more rust or game planning curry's playoff scoring wasn't quite as

otherworldly as his regular season stampedes which still made him an all-time level scorer just not an

outlier so much of defending curry is about what's happening away from the action and that kind of

defensive attention leads to open shots for the warriors this is curry's legendary

gravity pulling extra defenders into his orbit even when he didn't have the ball and

this is a sizable part of his offensive impact drawing the defense away from his

teammates as they freak out about his shooting the price to pay for devoting so many

resources to stopping steph's scoring was wide open layups at the hoop well

defense is fixated on curry and people often point out that

these defenders are merely confused which is true because guarding curry creates

confusion the margin for error is minuscule sometimes it's not even confusion the

jazz devote the entire weak side to keeping an eye on curry and even with three defenders they will

concede a draymond green triple before losing steph some gravity

is more subtle lebron would normally be closer to the block on the weak side

but he's whispering sweet somethings in steph's ear in the corner here's some relocation gravity where

none of these defenders are even thinking about closing out to clay thompson one of humanity's best shooters of the

round ball and sometimes defenders start anticipating what to do

and that leads to more layups these kinds of plays are exactly how a

so-called jump shooting team can lead the league in field goal percentage at the rim

we noted last episode how curry made life easier for duran and nothing symbolizes this better than

the second quarter of the 2017 finals where curry parted the seas for him not

once but twice in transition steph's shooting accuracy changed the rules on

the fast break where defenders prioritized him over guarding the ball at times

the traditional approach of sprinting back to the paint didn't work with him because they ended up leading to

practice shots reggie miller was the first player to regularly run to the three-point line in

transition but curry couldn't be given any air space from inside 30 feet so he could find cracks to

exploit when defenses weren't set this should be a layup here because durant prioritizes curry but he

also loses contact with staff and so it's a super efficient open three

this is exactly why you'll see defenders run to the line with staff leaving the paint wide open for a ball

handler you'll notice clay has a gravitational pull on defenders too

and this made the two of them so difficult to guard as a tandem and particularly in screening actions

where defenders are still accustomed to chasing thompson around screens and any brief lapse leaves one of the

two best shooters ever uncovered here curry turns this cut

into a screen his man keeps going to clay and the often stationary james harden

is left sealed off and it's a layup when defense is wisen up to his back

picks like this curry can then fake these screens slipping out to his personal atm

for some more cash so then defenders remind themselves always stay with steph always stay with

steph and that glues defenders to him well his teammates practice more layups

he was also a nasty little screener because smaller players tend to get away with additional contact and movement

as part of their natural grappling away from the action oh by the way curry could pass

too while his teammates were usually piling up assists from his off-ball movement

he could send it home himself for wide open layups too wide open some might say staff's

combination of movement and ball handling meant he could flow from a cut to a

drive to a kick out to feed his teammates and his release speed helped him turn an

off the dribble threat into a quick delivery for two all of his super giant gravity in

transition opened up passing lanes as well and it was the same story setting up for a deep

pull-up three jazz are pulled into his orbit and it's high percentage offense

at the hoop curry had good vision in general he's

probing for a pull-up but snaps off a live dribble pass instead and he hit a bunch of these

little creases in the middle of the floor in transition here's another quick trigger pass off

the bounce this time he whips it left-handed although clay wasn't really in the mood for a layup apparently

so it turns into a right-handed drive-in kick from curry kick-out passes were actually

a bit of an adventure for him because of how small he was he couldn't throw it over the top so

deflections were an issue and when he probed deeper size could swallow up his passing

angles and clog his outlet valves when he kept his gerbil alive and had

cleaner sight lines these turned into open threes but he could also dribble himself into a

forest of trees where he couldn't really see the best pass the top of the key is wide open

here and yet it's another deflection he could get into the paint and find

laydown passes when help came over but accuracy could also be a problem on

some of these deliveries some of steph's passing at the rim was a

bit wild like this note this was a no no-look attempt and curry mixed in his fair share of

lookaways to make up for that lack of passing height it also helped that he varied his

deliveries mixing hook passes with bouncers and little two-handed drop-offs like this

some of these were bold ideas this is a magic johnson heater past j.r smith's

ear and this play shows reflexes and court awareness spinning to find a teammate in tight

quarters however some bold ideas bordered on reckless

throwing errant behind the back passes or just wavering into sloppiness on basic deliveries leading to more

turnovers out of spread pick and roll he could deliver most passes

this is a basic strong side help off the shooter a pass away and here's a skip pass where the weak

side defender slides over to help and it's another draymond 3. it was actually rare for curry to get

downhill with this classic two-on-one because he usually just took a three against coverages like this he could

certainly hit the opposite side shooter but it was more common to see a

second defender jump him while his teammates rolled to the basket this is a bit late

because it was tricky throwing these around bigger defenders on this play the big man gives him space

so it's a much easier completion before the paint help arrives compare

that to this coverage where two huge defenders are involved one pressuring curry on the ball

while durant sits in front of the roller and it's a different pass another thing that changes his pick and

roll dynamic is where many of these screens are set curry's near the logo here

and so it takes longer to hit screeners who aren't shooting threats when they roll

this time it's staggered screens and again size makes it uncomfortable enough to bypass durant for a short roll pass

but he uses the look away and throws it out of bounds so steph saw most valuable passes on

screen and rolls it was often just a matter of finding a delivery angle so he could send it home

again this meant using those whip passes and hook passes that he loved with both hands and

he sprinkled in more audacious lobs or soft deliveries as well many teams

simply trapped the curry pick and roll just to get the ball out of his hands and that could stall the offense a touch

if hardin recovered on time here this wouldn't be an open kd jumper which is where draymond's short

roll passing became so critical gashing teams in these four on threes

green's ball handling high high-end vision and speed made him a phenomenal fit next to curry

where he could pick apart defenses as a roll man when opposing teams tried to neuter steph's three-point shooting

a great passing hub like draymond is an ideal partner for off-ball workhorses

like curry he can capitalize on steph's gravity from the top make extra passes after curry is trapped

or collapse the defense with the ball himself setting up arguably the greatest perimeter finisher ever

this helped those warriors teams put together phenomenal regular season offenses

and while they were still great in the playoffs they fell back a little commentary with curry's drop in scoring

we saw earlier keep in mind though team sold out to take away his scoring

so that huge off-ball effect made him a playmaking machine estimates of his shot

creation land in the top 15 of all time and it's hard to say how well that even accounts

for his unique ability to stretch defenses so there are lingering questions about his

offensive impact in the playoffs but before we get to those we need to look at just how effective he

was on the defensive end i might oh this is him yeah he's

speaking to the mic i thought she was doing a ricky bobby thing like oh this is my mic i got you i'm feeling i'm feeling great but um

i'm excited about the finals we got four wins to go so hopefully get it done while the warriors dynasty set a new

standard for offensive excellence they were also a high-end defensive team

as one of the best defenders of the 21st century draymond green led golden state's

switchable intelligent scheme on that end and because the warriors surrounded curry

with four players who were six foot six or taller most of the time it was common practice for teams to

target steph in the playoffs the cavs did this in bursts during all of their final matchups

looking for a switch onto the dangerous kyrie irving or the much larger lebron james who

could use his size to back curry down into the post and force help or score himself

in the 2018 western finals houston hunted curry even more since attacking weak spots

with james harden or chris paul was a core part of their offense this strategy adds to curry's physical wear

and tear potentially slowing down his attack and getting him into foul trouble

but otherwise it wasn't enormously effective because curry held up pretty well against even the game's best

isolation scorers kyrie gives up on this one with green finally shifted over

and against hardin there were strong moments he jabs at the ball twice and disrupts him

then crowds him and takes one in the ear for an offensive foul steph was pesky on the ball like this

using his hands quite a bit the left hand slows down the driver the right hand then controls him a little

and he was small enough to get away with this contact he was actually really physical in

general on defense actively pawing at the ball and bodying up ball handlers with his

hands high when they drove like this he didn't have incredible lateral

quickness he goes to put some weight into irving here and turns into a matador trying to recover

but he wasn't smoked off the dribble too frequently because of how active he was on the balls of his feet his willingness to get

physical and his reaction time notice the really short steps which helps him stay balanced so he can

quickly change directions with the ball handler you can see how sharp his reflexes are here

sliding with harden's crossover immediately bodying him hard and then he smothers a

shot at the end curry loved attacking the ball at the end of a move like this

he's a bit behind on this one but ends up with a late strip and his hands were active on the outside

as well preventing a step back attempt on this play steph was often trying to overcome a

size disadvantage he wasn't going to throw off many shots vertically so attacking the rock

low like this gave him a chance even if it led to some fouls in the process

that hand-eye coordination helped him connect on plenty of these when he was balanced and had a clear

look at the ball catching leather not once but twice in this sequence

he's completely beaten here again grabs an arm to slow down the dribbler and the hands save the play from behind

because he was only 6'2 curry was a mismatch for bigger players on the block

on this one he tries to hold off lebron but james is too powerful and so it's a foul

his counter measure for this was to front the post hard and deny an entry pass in the first

place and because he had a high revving motor he was pretty successful with this technique

here he sits down to take away the entry then works hard to track the ball at a different angle and comes up with a

steal the warriors had other techniques to protect him pre-switching curry here so he wouldn't

be involved in the pick and roll and then draymond sees a potential mismatch and breaks up the post pass beautifully

steph could also get really physical with screeners which helped avoid a switch and kept

everyone on their original assignment although crowding potential screeners and getting

handsy with them opened up a few back door cuts and when steph overplayed off ball shooters like

this he occasionally received a taste of his own medicine unsurprisingly he was also physically

chasing players off the ball he could lean over his toes and get off balance like that

and again here's some hand fighting and subtle holding to stay connected and then on the ball

more of the usual jabbing at the rock and sliding to stay in front of the dribbler

when guarding the ball handler he could power through some of these screens sometimes to stay with his man

and even if that didn't work he was quite good about staying connected to the screener on a switch

using his bag of tricks i'd say he was generally good navigating ball screens

here steering the dribbler away from the screen by design then activating those hands on the roll

pass for another steal on this one he steps up in front of the screen nicely to avoid it

and that contains everything well although curry gambles for a steal and that exposes the warriors in the

paint he actually rarely took overt gambles like that he was selective about selling out for

these sneak attacks and his ability to play passing lanes was based more on anticipation and reflexes

than on risk taking this again made him similar to bird their best defensive strength was

reading these kinds of passes and timing up interceptions without taking needless chances this is a three on one and he

spots the passer's eyes to make an incredible save off the lob and then going the other way turns it

into two points himself steph was also dangerous sneaking around

outlet passes like this and yeah that's probably going in and it is time to dance on the floor

here's one off the inbounds and this time curry wants to bring clay into the party and that team was just unfair

between his active hands and his ability to jump passes like this curry landed in the 93rd percentile

historically in steals during these years he was also smart about timing up his double teams

and what's key here is that he keeps going after the first effort saving a layup with the extra help and

he rarely missed these second and third efforts on a defensive sequence flowing from one responsibility to the

next that's a decent closeout to end the possession although i wouldn't say he was that

effective closing out because his size made jumpers easier for shooters his small stature was a

limiting factor on paint rotations too where he could slide into position but couldn't offer much resistance at

the rim steph was generally on point when he needed to rotate into the lane like this

and that's far better than being bigger but late to arrive or blowing the assignment

here's a nice example where he's early to help on the pick and roll then gives extra effort to tag a cutter

when the ball switches to the other side of the court but still he added basically zero rim

protection on high leverage plays where he needed to plug up the back line and despite his consistent effort he had

an occasional attentional lapse focusing in on the ball too much and falling a few steps out of position

impact metrics actually view him as a solid positive defender although his overall playoff numbers are

far more pedestrian than his incredible regular season stats but even if injuries weren't the reason

why his missed time still skewed these impact numbers his teammates were able to inflate their

plus minus by playing weaker teams in early rounds but steph's plus minus was accrued

against championship level opponents in the later rounds if we calculated the

numbers after curry returned from his injuries giving his teammates the same opponents as him

suddenly steph looks like one of the most impactful playoff performers on record

even with a clear drop in 2016 compared to his surrounding seasons

and at least to me that's a compelling signal that the extra defensive attention he

received still shredded defenses even if his scoring dipped as a result

furthermore in larger regular season samples his numbers were still incredibly

impressive against strong defenses when compared to weak ones maintaining most of his volume and

efficiency relative to other great players there's also some evidence that he'll

ramp up his scoring more when he shares the floor with weaker finishers his volume with durant and thompson on

the bench resembles video game levels and these numbers are similar in a much larger regular season sample

throughout all of these permutations golden state's efficiency with curry on the court

remained elite while they crushed their opponents i do still have some concerns about his

durability attacking him on defense and wearing down his legs seemed to have some effect but curry's gravity is a

constant phenomenon that made him arguably the most scalable offensive weapon in basketball history

making life easier for basically any other offensive star he doesn't have the

typical signs of an impact defender but he also doesn't look like a negative on that end either

instead his incredible value comes almost entirely from his otherworldly shooting

off-ball impact and that on-ball play-making which is a one-of-a-kind package that

combined to make steph curry perhaps the best offensive

player in nba history

kareem abdul-jabbar was a seven foot two

basketball unicorn

an ideal offensive centerpiece who could

score

and pass combined with a looming

defensive presence in front of the rim

he's arguably the sport's most decorated

player three titles in college

six in the nba and a record six mvp

trophies

thanks to the game's most dominant

weapon but was he just the product of a

weak

era were his defensive criticisms valid

or when he put it all together at the

peak of his powers

was he the best center of all time

you are watching what greatness is all

about

where's larry bird in all this has it

this series tackles one question who was

the best

at his best we started the aba merger

and go through the best

multi-year stretches examining the

legends who provided the most

on court impact these are the greatest

peaks

as a 1960s phenom in new york city

kareem was friendly with wilt

chamberlain who we examined in the

series prelude but he wasn't built to

replicate wilt's powerful scoring style

jabbar's approach was crafted around his

incredible height

and graceful agility he easily could

have been listed at 7-3 or 7-4

if measured in shoes but he wasn't some

uncoordinated ant

instead moving like a smaller player

that athletic combination was enough in

high school

he won two national titles and in

college winning three national titles

and famously bludgeoning the defending

national champ varsity team at ucla

with his freshman squad but to become a

legend in the nba jabar needed a weapon

that matched his physical makeup

that's right the sky hook this cloud

scraping dance step was a

basketball cheat code we don't have

tracking data on

every one who flicked up over the years

but by my eye it grew

sharper sturdier and more accurate as

the 70s progressed

kareem began adding weight to his lower

body through the years

and by 1977 still had similar mobility

to his college days

with a much sturdier base

in his earlier years physical defenders

could interfere with his setup

that melodic left foot step to turn

those shoulders at just the right launch

angle

you can see his balance is disrupted

here but by 1977

another 10 or 15 pounds on his frame

allowed him to find and hold his spots

more easily

and he could comfortably hook right into

defenders when crowded

we might take it for granted because it

appears effortless

but it took years of samurai precision

to forge this unique basketball sword

defense has tried to stop it by blocking

that left foot step

but kareem could just step up court away

from the hoop

almost like his version of a step back

disrupting his rhythm or landing space

could throw off the accuracy

that's a foul today but not then but

otherwise this was a high percentage

attempt from just about anywhere

inside 15 feet as teams

overplayed the hook kareem developed

counters like a turnaround jumper

this probably felt like a win to most

defenders but with a high release point

it was another viable weapon

he also went to a lefty hook although it

lacked the devastation of the polished

right-hander

kareem also had that classic big man

game like

finding deep position or using his size

to just

turn and shoot right over smaller

defenders

sometimes he'd just bust out a spin and

drop the

hammer who says big men are boring show

yourself

this repertoire made abdul-jabbar the

gold standard of scoring for the first

40 years of the league

if we adjust for inflation to today's

norms from 1977 to 1979

kareem averaged 28 points every 75

possessions in the playoffs

on efficiency 11 and a half percent

better than the opponent's defense

only reggie miller has ever touched that

kind of true shooting

on such volume in the postseason and

only three players ever have scored at

least 30

on plus seven percent true shooting

this record-setting scoring forced

opponents to react

which meant kareem could set up his

teammates entire defenses bent toward

him

there's four in his airspace and since

the 77 lakers lacked players who could

create their own offense

a few extra feet for a jumper made a

difference he could skip it cross-court

like this

to find an open opportunity new laker

coach jerry west constructed an attack

where kareem was flanked with shooters

who could benefit from his double teams

which wasn't as destructive as today's

three-point specialist

but still provided value for secondary

players back then

without the ball jabar even generated

gravity because defenders were so

preoccupied with him

during their 77 showdown bill walton was

reluctant to leave jabar at times

he's preoccupied with his movement here

instead of his usual help at the rim

and here's walton just face guarding him

with a second defender dragged over

creating another open jumper

kareem was also prolific finding cutters

from these scoring hot spots

he wasn't the high post quarterback

walton was bill probably connects there

and he didn't have perfect feel for

tight ones like this but

jabbar had his share of impressive dimes

it didn't always feel organic but he was

such a studious player that once he

learned a situation he could exploit it

kareem hit most of these little back

doors

and was comfortable with handoffs as

well

and these late prime years were arguably

his best as a passer

i think this play from his last great

offensive season in 1980

sums him up as a playmaker finding a

teammate cross court

then taking a second but still finding a

great layup pass

he was also a strong outlet passer

firing like an

outfielder when he could set up a

teammate streaking down the court after

a rebound

kareem's childhood love of baseball no

doubt influenced this pass

slinging bombs nearly the length of the

court at times and these one-handed

outlets are a forgotten part of his game

all of this took him two heights wilt

could never reach on offense

he was a more efficient scorer because

of far better free throw shooting

and he leveraged his scoring to help

teammates

this guard is sitting on kareem's hook

so he audibles to an open

shooter also this might be my favorite

cream play ever where he fakes the guard

off his hook just to set it up and look

he slaps his hands in disgust at the

mere idea that he gave up a hook

using our best estimates jabbar created

five to six

open shots per game for teammates like

this by drawing extra defenders

cream of the crop numbers until the late

80s when superstars reached

8 or 9 shots created per game and that

gravity made things easier for teammates

too

wilt would often park himself on the

block and clog

any driving lanes but kareem could flow

into different spots in the paint to

catch and score

and this offensive variety allowed

teammates to fit more comfortably around

his post game

from 1977 to 79 the leakers finished

about two points ahead of league average

on offense

without an abundance of offensive talent

a testament to kareem's ability to

raise a team's offensive floor but jabar

also fit next to better players on

championship level attacks in 1980 when

more talent arrived with jim jones

michael cooper and magic johnson

and in the early 70s with the box next

to bobby dandridge and the aging oscar

robertson

robertson missed 18 games in 1973 and 74

and the bucks actually improved their

scoring differential by three points

without him

playing around a 70 win pace strong

evidence that

prime kareem could captain an elite

offense with decent perimeter talent

around him

while i don't think he could have

replicated walton's high post passing in

portland's system

the lakers offense in 1977 with its own

cast of dependent players around jabbar

was almost as efficient as the blazers

and

no big man could replicate those

high-end offenses built around kareem

for decades here's every offense since

1955

where the team leader in offensive load

that is the player doing the most heavy

lifting

was a big man those high-end offenses

built around the sky hooks stand out

and cream's teams stayed above water

when the surrounding talent was bare

it's only in the mid 90s that names like

barkley malone and shaq

led comparable regular season offenses

that were built around

big men the bigger question about abdul

jabar back then

and historically is more about his

defense and

how much it actually held him back

i think you're the greatest but my dad

says you don't work hard enough on

defense

30 years after retiring kareem is still

third

all-time in block shots despite the stat

not being tracked in his first four

seasons

that incredible length helped him defend

the rim well

making basic shots difficult for

finishers with his giant swat

radius and on some of these rim contests

he got

way up there's another one of those

baseball outlets for an easy score

but he occasionally had problems judging

goaltending when he was so high kareem

loved to spring off his left foot like

this

taking a big plant step and extending

the right hand to slap the ball

and that made for some incredible saves

look at how gracefully he recovers for

this chase down block

the downside of this left leg right hand

two step

is that it requires time to unwind and

in more traditional vertical situations

he couldn't always target releases

perfectly

at times he's organizing his feet to

jump but then an extra dribble throws

him off and he can't react in time

same thing here a touch late responding

so the window to load up and jump is too

small and that

is kobe bryant's dad ladies and

gentlemen

reaction time was an issue for kareem he

bites on a fake here and then lacks a

quick burst from two feet

without clearly seeing the shot this

entire play he's a frame behind

the head turning to the ball late frozen

by the pump fake

then swiping at air after the ball's

gone this is a subtle

issue but pedestrian reflexes chipped

away at some of his defensive value

here's one where his hands are down and

he's frozen expecting a shot not a pass

but again that lag and reaction time

prevents a possible save

his motor played a role too he logs so

many minutes with a heavy offensive load

that there wasn't gas left in the tank

for bouncing around

on every single defensive trip

this shows up in his defensive

rebounding where he was notably

inconsistent about boxing out

often just relying on his huge reach to

grab boards

his size alone made him a good rebounder

but a higher revving engine would have

made him a great one

in those moments he shifted into

overdrive the flashes were impressive

blending his size and athleticism into a

human wall

at the basket his hands weren't always

up but he could make great plays with

that length

when he was determined to react and put

forth multiple efforts on a play

also legendary traveling signal kareem

didn't have many

overt defensive breakdowns and even when

seeding ground he could still reach many

shots

so many of those were long distance

blocks the

kind that erase an attempt but don't

prevent one

the very best paint defenders deter the

highest percentage shots from even being

taken

and so it's ironic that kareem averaged

more blocks per game than bill walton

while appearing to contest fewer shots

some of kareem's best defensive

possessions weren't even blocks

here he alters rick berry's attempt and

then defending the pass

freezes barry into a travel abdul-jabbar

was also fairly mobile outside the paint

for his time

there just weren't many jitterbugs who

could punish him on switches

although again there's no second effort

here for a rebound

and it's a putback score yet these

old-school pick and rolls were a

strength of his

sliding down to help or sometimes out to

a guard when needed

and moving with him comfortably his feet

weren't cat quick

but his general mobility was superb in

these spots

for his era he wasn't always aware of

all the threats around him

he telescopes in on the ball here but

completely loses his man behind him

although his strong rim protection

clearly made him a defensive

asset if we examined kareem's missed

games in the middle of the 1970s

the same method from last episode we can

estimate

just how impactful his defense and

overall game were

in 37 missed games kareem's team

stumbled to a negative 2.9

adjusted point differential about a

32-win pace for a season

and with him they played it a positive

3.6 differential

or a 52 win pace it's not quite the

absurdity of walton's unique impact in

portland

but the story is the same in both

milwaukee in 1975

and la in 1978 making it less likely he

was situationally lucky

and that his impact was in line with the

all-time greats

in a highly competitive league in the

middle of the 70s with teams packed

together

kareem's two-way value lifted likely

lottery teams

to fringe contenders status by the way

we have to take some liberties with

those 1978 games he missed because

la made a number of trades afterwards

but that seems fair given how those

other pieces didn't move the needle

for instance in 28 games without jamal

wilkes the lakers were even

better playing at a 55 win pace

adrian dantly's fit on the team was also

questionable

eating away post-possessions from kareem

without jabbar those teams primarily

suffered on offense

echoing what we see on tape his defense

is still good enough though to include

him among the sacred

peaks we should also note that his post

defense had similar strengths and

weaknesses to his paint help

his size definitely bothered big men who

couldn't stretch him away from the hoop

but he avoided

banging a lot see that little separation

he yields

and again the reaction is a bit slow on

this turnaround

here's a clear look notice how he pulls

away with his hips instead of holding

ground

and that's a decent contest but this

technique allows for too much freedom

and space and can easily backfire

hey it's big red if we ran the same

numbers for kareem that we did for

walton

against all-star centers in the

mid-1970s the results would be more

pedestrian

he shaved about two points off their

normal true shooting

although remember kareem never really

had a bruising partner like maurice

lucas to play alongside of

off-court personality aside it's easy to

see how kareem's defensive weaknesses

and his cheat code often could produce

criticism

despite incredible on-court results he

simply made it look

too easy at times in many ways his

outlying height

dexterity and studiousness made him the

ideal two-way player of his

time big man defense combined with

offensive impact that wings struggled to

match before the spacing of the

three-point

era our one-number metrics that reach

back in time

have him competing with just about the

best multi-year stretches on

record pipm also has him in the top 10

here

using 1976-1978

sure he could have had a better motor or

sharper reflexes

but that might have just been unfair he

won 6 mvps anyway

and made 11 all defensive teams most of

them warranted in my estimation

and so for me he might have peaked on

defense in milwaukee

with those younger legs under him but

the ascension of his offensive game

the robotic soul-sucking mastery of the

sky hook

and that arsenal of counters make kareem

abdul-jabbar

one of the five best centers in nba

history

at his peak

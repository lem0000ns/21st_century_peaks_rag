at the slender age of 21 kevin durant

finished second in mvp voting

on a league best 30 points per game

over the years he improved his ball

handling playmaking and defense

winning the mvp in 2014. but

just how good was he in those areas

should he have been an all-league

defender and was his combination of

size agility and world-class

outside shooting enough to make him the

greatest scorer

of all time you are watching

what greatness is all about where's

larry bird in all this

has it walked by elijah michael jordan

saves the

this series tackles one question who was

the best

at his best we start at the aba merger

and go through the best

multi-year stretches examining the

legends who provided the most

on-court impact these are the greatest

peaks

kd what is it that you do better than

anybody

and you don't have to be humble here

we're just not just a small

group of friends and people with cameras

honestly i think i scored better than

anybody in oklahoma city

durant was a scoring animal claiming

four scoring titles in five seasons

the slim reaper was just the fourth

player in league history

with a dominant scoring stretch like

that joining wilt chamberlain

michael jordan and the one and only ice

man

you figured it out yet no not that ice

man

but george girvin a six foot seven point

machine

who was all arms and legs too girvin had

a soft sweet stroke

lived in the mid-range in that era and

of course he could finger roll

he was also so long he could just shoot

right over defenders

which made him a pre-three-point era

prototype

for duran kd was an upgrade in just

about every area

he was even bigger standing six nine and

a half without shoes

and like ice he could work off screens

and find little sweet spots to detonate

from

but durant could also launch from behind

the arc

and 39 3-point shooting during these

seasons

juiced his scoring efficiency you'll

notice how many of these shots involve

movement because sliding around to find

scoring pockets

and then catching and shooting was a

huge part of durant's success

59 percent of his outside shots were

assisted

around average among high-volume

long-range shooters

he wasn't a jitterbug without the ball

but he could throw off some defenders

flipping this cut back around the screen

beautifully

and because he was a super-sized wing

with a 7-5

wingspan he could drop these right over

strong contests from

big men yet he had enough agility in him

to backdoor

this action when he felt an overplay and

this takes nice

feel to read a defender and his size

made these lobs easy to finish

because he was such a large target

guards could throw over the top to him

like this

and he was slithery enough to catch off

a screen

and attack all the way to the cup so in

addition to great shooting from the

mid-range

and deep kd could put it on the deck and

finish in traffic with those

praying mantis arms this dribble drive

game was a huge part of his scoring

prowess

because if teams tried to run him off

the line he was

one dribble from a layup with the size

to finish

kevin could initiate these attacks

flying into a big man and finishing

nicely here

but if that big man sagged off in the

pick and roll he could burn them with

his

pull-up three this put defenses in a

serious pickle

because he had the range precision of a

modern guard

but if they overreacted to his shooting

he could blow by and finish among the

trees at the rim

his ball handling and a little bit of

shiftiness

boosted this penetration game but he

also had some burst in his engines

covering a ton of ground in just a

dribble or two

it looks like he's preparing to use this

screen

this defender is worried about a pull up

3 so he crosses back over and

accelerates downhill for free throws

by the way putting kd on the line was a

bad idea

since he shot a little under 90 percent

in those years

and he was able to get there with some

regularity thanks to tricks like the rip

through move

he also would drive into some contact

there's a huge crossover and he just

plows into the help for the

plus one but durant's rim finishing was

more about his

speed and long strides than strength or

physicality

he builds up a head of steam here picks

up his dribble at the free throw line

and sidesteps to create a little opening

and he's so long it's a drop in the

bucket

that's usually some smothered chicken by

tim duncan

against a smaller player durant used

these

euro-like steps to slip past defenders

in space

and here kawhi leonard runs him off the

line durant wisely attacks his front leg

and then look at all the ground he

covers with a single stride

big men were often worried about

durant's pull-up

it was a larger part of his attack than

getting all the way to the hoop

so he could use a little hesitation to

freeze them and then gallop home with

those long

legs he didn't get to the basket as

often as someone like lebron did

but when he did durant was extremely

efficient

finishing with the 14th best field goal

percentage at the rim since 2001.

like lebron kd was a weapon in

transition

sometimes he'd turn up the speed and

pressure backpedaling opponents

and he could also run to the three-point

line and drop daggers from there as

a finisher these skills work together

this defender jumps to the three-point

line but durant just

floors it for the flush and the

interplay between

long-range shooting and hard drives like

this

made him an elite transition scorer

during these seasons

he also liked to walk into threes in

semi-transition

there's that range again and between his

long arms and a little elevation

his release point on these was nearly

unblockable

little hops and hesitation moves force

defenders to worry about his drive

and that creates enough airspace to

stroke these pull-ups

over the outstretched arms of the

longest defenders in the game

even more so than girvin before him

durant's ability to just

rise up over players and rain jumpers on

their head

gave him access to mid-range shots

almost

on demand of course this is the least

efficient of his scoring zones

but by 2016 he improved his mid-range

accuracy

to about 49 a jump of over four

percentage points

from his earlier seasons when he won mvp

and enough to regularly land him

at or near the top of the league from

this distance

however as a three-point shooter kd was

far

more accurate in catch-and-shoot

situations

than off of these pull-ups from 2014 to

18

he was a scorching 43 on catch and shoot

attempts

according to second spectrum's optical

tracking but he was just

under 35 on his pull-ups so

he wasn't quite as lethal on these

self-generated attempts

he could certainly generate shots with

his back to the basket

again using his size to just rise up

over defenders

while comfortably working out of the mid

post area to find little fade aways or

turn arounds like this

his post game included a mini dirk

nowitzki impression

occasionally flashing that ridiculous

one-legged fall away

like the big german himself

durant's height allowed him to take

smaller players to the block

undersized guards like this offered

little resistance that close to the hoop

but stick bigger forwards on him and he

could torture them by running around

screens

bigger players aren't used to chasing

world class outside shooters

and kevin was most comfortable catching

and shooting without a dribble like this

tarantula's ability to score at three

levels

both on and off the ball made him

arguably the greatest

regular season scorer we've ever seen

in the playoffs however his

effectiveness fell back to earth just a

bit

which still made him one of the great

scorers in league history

like all players his statistics were

influenced by his

teammates and his opponents without a

teammate to break down defenses

and set him up for easier looks durant's

numbers as the lone

offensive focal point look quite

different than when he plays next to

another star

from 2014 to 18 with russell westbrook

or steph curry on the court next to him

kd's scoring efficiency looks

really good compared to other high

volume scores

but without those star guards occupying

defensive attention

he took a sizable dip in efficiency

because he had to create

more of his own offense there was a

significant

increase in his unassisted field goals

in those situations

now thinking basketball regulars know

that carrying an offense as a

lone star isn't the be-all end-all

there's arguably more value in creating

scoring

next to other high-end talent still

both roles are relevant especially since

so much of kevin durant's impact

is rooted in his scoring game and

the opportunities that scoring game

helped him create

for his teammates

another vicious dunking last night

here's what we know

suspect is six nine wiry short hair nice

smile

why are we in 2016 the thunder took a 73

win warriors team

to the brink before new york city

tourist clay thompson

went into nba jam mode in game six

and helped golden state survive in a

classic seven

game series that was one of durant's

bumpier series during his prime

largely because the warriors overloaded

his side while ignoring his weaker

shooting teammates

sliding an extra defender smack into

kd's driving lane

allowed for greater ball pressure and

pushed him into

difficult contested jumpers this made it

harder to attack the rim

and a decent decline in shooting

percentages at the hoop

was one reason why durant's playoff

scoring lagged behind his regular season

output

with both outside defenders hugged in

and up

into durant's driving gaps clay plays

him tightly

and durant fumbles it which kills a ton

of clock and leads to a desperate

attempt

andre roberson's open because he's a 28

shooter from the corner when kd

played in golden state defenses couldn't

pack the pain on him

because of the splash brothers threat to

shoot so scoring became

easier for him there's an entire video

on this channel about these extreme

differences

if you're interested for instance the

warriors just

ignore sergey baka on this play to drop

a defender into the lane

and that leads to a ball handling

turnover from kevin

despite some of these slick crossovers

that helped him penetrate or pull up

he had his share of fumbles and flubs as

such a tall

ball handler dribbling through a sea of

defenders

might work for leo messi but in

basketball passing is the natural

counter we've seen this from other

modern wings in this series

where soft doubles are attacked with

timely and accurate skip

passes durant could throw these passes

at this point in his career although it

could take him a beat to

recognize one of these this is a bit of

a floater

which makes the first close out easier

but still leads to a good shot

again notice he gathers himself first

but then flicks a quick pass the kind

that makes it harder to close out to

and it ends up in a three ball in the

corner pocket

kd did have some diversity on his

releases

and passing off the bounce with his

right hand like that

exploited gaps defenders can't

anticipate the pass

making slingshots like this much harder

to react to

here's a great delivery out of pick and

roll blending a

dribble into a skip pass and again

throwing early

provides more time for any shooter who

was good enough to close out to

and durant's handle and some passing

flexibility

let him play make out of these pick and

roll actions

remember defenses still had to focus on

him as a pull-up

weapon off of screens and he could use

that threat to find

pass increases here going to the

hesitation

and then passing after freezing the

defender

and he could make little pocket passes

like this too with his rolling big men

although this particular pass was

actually a thorn in his side

leading to plenty of batted balls and

turnovers

these passes can't just be mindlessly

flicked into empty

space and kd had lackadaisical moments

as a distributor

throwing deliberate or even telegraphed

passes

here's one where he fires it off a leg

initially but on the recovery comes back

to it with a little

drop off and these were some of his

better passes

able to punish helping defenders when he

got downhill

i like that he threw some of these

laydowns early that's a pretty quick

reaction to nearly set up a dunk

and it requires solid vision to identify

openings like this

as they begin to emerge he's still not

someone i'd call a

natural playmaker though he was thinking

score first here instinctively dribbling

before spotting the wide open layup

this meant he wasn't a really strong off

ball passer

in part because he was looking to catch

and score on these

he could make this pass off a curl but

it wasn't a consistent

find for him on this one he just misses

a wide open look

under the rim and this looks like one of

those problematic ball handling

situations

where he wasn't smooth picking up his

dribble

this one's a more basic pick and roll

attack right-handed dribble

into tons of space under control

and he gets below the free throw line

for a gorgeous little drop off

however he didn't always take that extra

dribble

that's a nice little pocket pass but if

kd attacks the gap

it gets his roll man a step deeper and

potentially opens up the corner pass

we saw lebron james regularly take that

dribble last episode

whereas durant was often quick to pick

it up near traffic

or not always attack these gaps this is

a two on one with the roll man

but even though the defender starts

retreating he pulls up for a tricky

jumper

instead of applying more pressure

in transition he didn't need to get deep

into the paint

because his speed and pull-up shooting

provided enough pressure to draw extra

defensive attention

and when he did push having his head up

and more space

made these more comfortable hookups for

him

speaking of transition he played with a

one-man fast break

in westbrook who carved up defenses

himself with violent bursts of speed

that thunder team was really a two-man

operation

with role players flanking them in

support and westbrook had some chemistry

setting up durant as part of his

off-ball game

katie couldn't create for his teammates

like westbrook

but estimates of his shock creation land

him at about

85 of kobe bryant's peak from episode 10

making him a grade a offensive

centerpiece

durant might not have been ideal in a

heliocentric role

as a lone offensive creator but his

off-ball game added tons of value

next to other competent playmakers kd

could space the floor for his teammates

especially as a power forward and his

shooting provided some gravity

that made things easier for other

players on offense

this is a highly scalable attack able to

plug in next to other superstars without

the ball

and add value as a secondary playmaker

between his elite scoring off-ball

shooting

and solid ability to create for others

durant's been part of some seriously

high-end offenses

first in okc in spite of some of their

spacing issues

and then as a key piece in golden state

where he joined an incredible attack and

made them even better

on defense durant's versatility played

right into the warriors switching scheme

this allowed them to play the vaunted

hamptons 5 lineup

with katie adding an element of rim

protection to a smaller group

that expansive 7 foot 5 wingspan

gave him some rim protecting chops and

as a small forward

he was a high-end shot blocker take this

play

where he's actually late to rotate and

help but once he arrives he can defend a

big

right at the rim so as a wing on the

court

he was an additional paint defender who

could challenge high value shots like

this

and when he played the 4 he was still

able to plug up the back line

with all that length and of course he

could switch multiple positions

he starts out guarding draymond green

but picks up clay out of this scrum

and then slides up and defends the goal

with those pterodactyl wings

here's a clutch play where golden state

switched to ball screen

because good luck attacking draymond

green so that leaves thompson

on a bigger skilled post player and with

draymond on the perimeter

durant can still come over and defend it

this kind of length and versatility is

perfect for these spaced out switching

defenses that became more popular during

these seasons

now despite durant's size he wasn't a

defensive big man by

nature and that meant he wasn't that

physical down low

and didn't take up space in traffic or

throw his body onto powerful players

he also wasn't comfortable planting

himself in driving lanes and playing

goalkeeper

and would often contest shots from

deeper under the basket

he didn't have the best timing as a shot

blocker he jumps way before

the shooter here and it's a foul this

held him back a little bit

as a shot blocker but the more important

issue was not always being in position

to defend some of these shots

kevin could be a bit spacey at times

you see him check the corner then stare

right at this cut as it unfolds

yet he doesn't react until the ball

almost arrives

if he moved earlier he's not going to be

buried under the rim

or there might not be a pass at all some

of these plays were classic

cases of ball watching while a cutter

flew by

and he could have momentary lapses

assuming this was going to be a handoff

and there's that mis-timed jump on the

recovery

vision could also be an issue too there

were moments where he struggled to

locate the basketball

and i'm not sure he knew a pass was made

when he was called to switch onto the

shooter

chasing players off ball like this

occupied some of those limited

attentional resources

and his size made navigating screens a

bit tricky

especially in an era where offensive

linemen i mean

screeners can move pretty liberally

on this one he's preparing for one

screen but it's reversed and without

tight cornering skills

durant takes a wide path back to the

shooter so it's a clean look

when he was guarding the dribbler

directly he could still get hung up on

ball screens like this

but he could also fight through some of

these screens

battling the pick while keeping ball

handlers within that giant

reach of his switching schemes were

ideal for kd

precisely because he had some success

against a variety of players

on the perimeter the emphasis here is on

some because he could author really

effective possessions against

elite wing players when all of his

lateral movements synced up with the

ball handler

or when he didn't have to react to

sudden stop and go moves

and then that length could work wonders

against shiftier opponents he was

vulnerable to sudden changes in

direction

it's a lot for him to snap his hips

around to track curry here

and in general he didn't have great

acceleration from a standstill

when he was in a defensive stance like

this compare that to a more straight

line attack with

kd swiveling his hips at an angle to

stay with the drive

and that's a nice defensive stand here's

another one against a curry pull back

and because durant can decelerate well

his length just

eats this up good post scorers with some

muscle

could find success against him near the

bucket but he was rarely a mismatch when

checking bigs down on the block

since he was often just as tall as them

and his capacity to mix perimeter

responsibilities

with big man responsibilities like

rotating back to the paint

after guarding a pick and roll is a nice

value add in any flexible switching

scheme the kind that tends to have more

value

throughout the gauntlet of the post

season

his impact metrics on defense are a bit

up and down

but on average they see him as a small

positive and i think

that's in the right ballpark which puts

his overall numbers in the vicinity of

some of the other greats in this series

his numbers were actually better in

golden state

swapping in his injured 2019 playoffs

in place of his final run in okc where

he was dragged down by some poor

shooting some of that shooting might

have been bad

luck but some of it was being a primary

focal point

that defenses could load up on in golden

state he was able to blend his on-ball

scoring

with his considerable off-ball talents

in a more

ideal hybridized role that didn't strain

his self-generated scoring

or ask too much of his playmaking this

hybrid package

helped him generate impressive offenses

next to a ball dominant player like

russell westbrook

and then turn a great offense into the

best one

ever in golden state so while he wasn't

a

classic offensive quarterback his

incredible shooting

and overall scoring package along with

his versatile

positive defense combined to give kevin

durant

one of the greatest peaks in nba history

earvin magic johnson

the star of showtime a highlight reel

legend who won

five championships in los angeles but

was there more to his game than just

fancy passing

what was his defensive impact like and

could someone who wasn't a huge scorer

actually be the greatest offensive

player

in nba

what history is all about where's larry

bird in all this

has it blocked by elijah michael jordan

saves the day

this series tackles one question who was

the best

at his best we start at the aba merger

and go through the best

multi-year stretches examining the

legends who provided the most

on-court impact these are the greatest

peaks

magic's just a great basketball player

he's the best i've ever seen

you know i

unbelievable i don't know what to say in

the early days of the nba

ball handling was left to the shorter

players point guards maxed out at about

six foot

five until young magic johnson shattered

that ceiling

at six eight magic had the size of a big

man but instead he became the tallest

floor general in league history

irvin always possessed these high-level

ball skills

playing this way in high school and

college and his ability to handle the

ball

at high speed made him a unicorn in

transition

with everyone within 20 feet of the hoop

then rebounds turned into foot races and

magic speed strained backpedaling

defenders

that little change of direction is

enough to spin around the defense

and there are no bigs back to stop the

oversized johnson

with everyone chasing offensive rebounds

magic could often charge the rim

as the largest player and he loved that

in and out dribble

but also notice his change of direction

at speed

the big step one way then striding the

other

he wasn't quite a euro stepper in these

spots

but his use of elongated strides for his

height

was part of his downhill devastation

even against set defenders

that's a baby cut there to dust the

first offender a beautiful behind the

back dribble

and then almost a proto-euro step with a

big step right then changing directions

back to the left

he wasn't giannis but magic's size and

head of speed

made it difficult to keep him from

getting to the cup and so he became the

godfather of the grab and go

scooping a rebound and flooring it to

the other end

even on makes he would build speed and

drive it down your throat

danny ainge stays with the crossover

here but boston's center isn't back yet

so magic can easily clean up the miss

off this make he builds up speed and

seattle's center is near the three-point

line so that change of direction turns

him around and look at how low

and sturdy johnson is he's powering

through contact with his body

and it's free throws here come the

lakers again off a make

only this time boston has pieces in

place but magic

up shifts into a backpedaling age and so

help defenders need to sink into the

lane

and that just creates wide open offense

defenses who flooded the paint in

transition to wall off magic

still surrendered perimeter jumpers

these outside jumpers were big wins for

defenses

especially long twos but magic pressure

created a kind of

pick your poison where if help came he

smoked it with his passing

jack approves so that made big men

reluctant to leave their marks

and then magic just scored over smaller

defenders

his playmaking was so threatening he

could use it to unlock

scoring imagine playing defense against

this

if you sprint back magic uses that body

to cut you off and slow you down

and if you're a big man hustling back

you have to snap yourself around only to

cover ac

green flying down the wing but joke's on

you because the magician still has the

ball

of course magic's threat to score also

opened passing windows in turn

and this is all possible because of his

dribbling behind the back

through the legs whatever it took magic

was

incredibly secure with his handle in

tight spots changing speeds when needed

shielding the ball with his body and

snapping passes off the bounce

this allowed him to probe defenses he's

cut off well here

but protects the ball from a trailer and

then attacks with the left and again the

body protects the rock

he made it look easy but at 6 8 magic's

ability to protect the ball

at speed he was rarely ever stripped and

used his body to shield defenders

made him arguably the most dominant

transition weapon ever

it was largely the same story in the

half court ii this guard tries to funnel

magic

into this big man but he ends up bodying

him out of the play and it's free throws

irvin also used that tight handle and

change of speed

this stop and go turn jon stockton into

a matador

and magic's acceleration could blow by

athletic wings

he could also score from floater range

flowing into shots at all kinds of

angles with crafty little releases like

this

fist pump when headed right to left he

also had a

rolling hook shot from this range and he

could feel contact and immediately hop

into a soft shot attempt his size and

body control

made these looks clean and magic's

incredible dexterity led to some

seriously soft touch on these shots

he also used his size to pick apart

defenses from the perimeter

hurling assists over the top and the

accuracy and

speed on some of these deliveries set

them apart

again he's using his body here able to

shield off defenders by

turning his back while still seeing all

the action

and his height let him keep a live

dribble while just diming up teammates

over shorter guards

and these were some of the most

brilliant passes ever does anyone look

open here because magic slingshots a

pass

over traffic to worthy all because this

defender turned away from james to

navigate the screen

worthy stopped instead of going through

and magic's third eye read the whole

thing

johnson fired bold passes like this

across the paint regularly

and they required velocity and the

acuity to read defender's eyes so he

could throw fastballs

right by their heads and they couldn't

react in time

bonus points for trying this against

larry bird who already picked off a

tight magic pass earlier in that game

that one was a looping attempt and magic

clearly trusted his fastball more

sometimes even too much overestimating

how quickly he could teleport one

past a nearby defender

and there are spots where a lob or

something softer over the top

look open but he often throws it harder

here he needs to lob one out in front of

his intended receiver but misses it and

then he's called for a

one-step travel changing his mind

another minor nitpick about magic's

fastball is that sometimes it was a

little too hot to handle

but most of the time his passing

velocity fit the ball

into tight windows for instance some of

his entries from the top like this were

just

bull's-eyes he wasn't quite at bird's

level as an outlet passer

but he was splendid there as well able

to use that hairpin trigger off the

bounce from the back

court and magic's best outlets were

snapping completions to his streaking

teammates like this there is an argument

that bird was a better pure

passer of sorts but i'm comfortable

saying he was a superior

off-ball passer where magic's dribbling

gave him a huge on-ball

edge johnson carved out way more chances

and risk-taking in those spots is a

natural trade-off

he also mastered certain angles and

reads and relentlessly hit them over and

over

and so it's nearly impossible to argue

that anyone created more offense for his

teammates

in the 60s 70s or 80s than peak magic

johnson

using our best estimates of shots

created no one

forced help and then set up a teammate

more than magic until the 2000s

and even if we include everyone from the

three-point era

johnson still looks historically strong

as a playmaker

in these estimates so just how high did

all of this playmaking

take the lakers on offense and did magic

give back any of that value

because of questionable defense

the converse weapon that's the shoot

that's magic do what he was born to do

toward the end of the 80s more of magic

shock creation came in the half court

as the lakers moved away from a steady

diet of cream abdul-jabbar post-ups

and started running more pick and roll

for magic

these were mostly side pick and rolls

inside the line

where defenses committed extra defenders

and magic could spray passes for open

looks this two-man game gave defenses

fits where if they didn't send extra

defenders magic could slice into the

openings himself

but of course his passing punished any

help the defense collapses

and this was before that little lob pass

was popular

off pick and roll magic could use all

his little scoring tricks headed to the

rim

he could put that speedy hook pass to

good use hitting the roll man

and it wasn't as common but he could

make the pocket pass too

but perhaps the most critical part of

this half-court dance

was magic's outside shooting where he'd

punish defenders who went under the

screen

he didn't pull this as frequently as

some players do today

but there were times when he was quick

to fire and he was an underrated outside

shooter in the last three years of his

career he shot

90 percent at the foul line and he

extended his range beyond the

three-point strike

hitting 34 percent of those before the

87 season

magic said he had to shift his mindset

to become more of a scorer

and i think it's reflected in his

willingness to pull the trigger on

outside

shots and attack in the post more he was

more aggressive taking smaller players

to the block and using his size to score

over them like this although on these

little flip shots

he did need a clean look to be effective

so instead he regularly busted out hook

shots with both hands

and his combination of size strength and

craftiness

made him a serious mismatch against

guards down there

and yes if you send help he would set up

teammates from the block

look i'm not a doctor but double teaming

magic johnson in the post

is not something i'd recommend

as kareem faded the lakers actually

played

more in the half court behind magic

their pace was below

average from 1987 to 1991 and that's

when magic quarterbacks some of the most

efficient offenses in nba history

in the back half of the 80s the lakers

produced the third best offensive

stretch since the shot clock

in both the regular season and the

playoffs

defense however was another story

johnson often guarded forwards or slower

guards to offset his slow foot speed

his lack of lateral quickness made him

vulnerable on an island

and you can see how choppy his

side-to-side movement could be sliding

in front of a young charles barkley here

take a closer look at his footwork he's

on his heels a lot

gambles with a reach then can't really

break well and commits a reckless foul

same technique here and he's roasted by

a pedestrian point guard

although magic rarely had to venture

outside 20 feet in the 1980s like this

back then sagging way off guards who

stood near the line was standard

and this buffer helped him avoid

breakdowns in these matchups

when he played slower forwards his size

definitely helped him

hear birds not quick enough to beat

magic's loping steps

and as he lost some quickness at the end

of the decade

he could be assigned to jump shooting

bigs because la's forwards ac green and

james worthy

were both nimble enough to handle many

wings

if those big men were to take magic to

the post

his size offered some resistance

although even on the low

block his subpar agility and lack of

vertical explosion could be exploited

he was actually more comfortable double

teaming the post

where he could dig down and attack big

men of that

post-centric era although i wouldn't

call his hands

great they could miss the mark and he

would foul on imprecise swipes at times

at six foot eight he did make kick out

passes a touch harder

yet he didn't attack the ball on that

first dribble nearly as much as someone

like bird

often remaining upright on these plays

or offering a weak flail at the rock

magic's height was more of an asset on

entry passes from

smaller guards and here comes that

pseudo

euro step again this is an overhead view

of the perks of being tall

just throwing his hands up against a

smaller guard

and deflections like this trigger that

vaunted showtime fast break

like bird magic also roamed a lot on the

edge of the paint

so he could slide over on drives like

this when he wasn't doubling the post

here's a nice sequence where he stays

with the cutter and then peels off to

help on the action

and that deflection saved a boston layup

he could also help down on cutters at

the rim

sniffing this out and doing just enough

to disrupt it

and this is probably the best defensive

play i've seen him make in the late 80s

quickly reacting to the past this time

and those hands were right on the money

yet for all of his court vision magic

wasn't always aware of the ball

occasionally tunnel visioning on the

screening action in front of him

as the ball dribbled right past him he

also fell asleep every once in a while

after a jumper bird beat him over the

top twice with this in one game

here he is in transition unaware of the

threat behind him

and he gets a taste of his own medicine

but these issues weren't too common his

bigger issue in the paint was

verticality

he often slid over but offered a

statuesque resistance

and even magic's better rotations

weren't always effective

because of how floor-bound he was

here's a bumpy possession highlighting

his two biggest weaknesses

he can't contain the guard court side

because of his slow feet

then he lingers on the edge of the paint

and delicately slides to the ball

for a foul he rarely contested at the

rim in the half court

but in transition he was often the first

defender back

and he might as well have been five foot

eight in these situations

it's not a huge part of the game either

but this is probably the best transition

contest

i found in countless opportunities his

typical approach in these spots was

avoiding contact by

subtly moving out of the way which

preserved magick's body

in exchange for paper weight defense

zero inch vertical contests rarely work

he didn't block many shots during this

period and when he did catch one it was

using that same low block technique we

saw from bird

targeting the ball while it's in the

hand still and it's amazing to me how

similar yet different these two were

neither was suited to stay with quick

perimeter players

and they often roamed around on defense

taking advantage of the compressed game

back then

bird pushed boundaries as an off ball

post player and shooter

while magic cranked the dial up with his

on-ball passing and speed game

and they also played next to hall of

fame centers and while kevin mchale is

rightfully heralded as an artist in the

post

james worthy was an isolation machine

worthy blended perfectly with magic as

kareem faded

providing a more dynamic half-court

backup plan

note how many great magic passes are off

a worthy cut

and of course big game james was

incredible running the wing in

transition

unfortunately we can't really examine

their missed time during the 80s

because magic and his teammates were so

healthy but

the more comprehensive approach we used

in episode 1

that figured out a player's impact on

his team ranks magic

second all time reinforcing

at the very least that he was having

monster offensive

impact all in one metrics also view his

peak as one of history's very best

if we use 1986 instead of 1989 here he's

actually

fifth in both stats but i don't think

there's enough of a defensive boost from

that 86 season

to outweigh his increased offensive

aggression

at the end of the decade remember that

aggression

only enhanced his playmaking the

opposite phenomenon we discussed with

will chamberlain in episode

1. magic scored less than wilt

but was a far more dominant weapon

because he maximized his playmaking

off of his scoring he did this with near

optimal shot selection as well rarely

ever

forcing low percentage attempts or

settling for something easy before

testing the defense

magix also viewed as a good rebounder

because of his six or seven boards a

game

well listed as a point guard but he was

functionally closer to a wing

and wasn't overly physical boxing out

big men when switching on to them

and while there might have been a

tactical advantage to him cleaning the

glass to start the fast break

i think this kind of rebounding only

added a little defensive value

i do think he could string together

decent possessions in the moments where

his motor was revved up

but it's hard to view him as much of a

positive on that

end instead the offense is

so good it elevates him among the

legends by itself

his game does come with a small

trade-off he was significantly less

effective without monopolizing the

basketball

meaning any other on-ball star wouldn't

fit well

next to him but with post pieces or

good finishers he basically guaranteed

you a championship level offense

and that means despite only scoring 20

points per game

magic johnson has a strong case

as the greatest offensive player of all

time

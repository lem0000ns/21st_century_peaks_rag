in this series we've seen two types of

big men

the first anchored the defense while

playing a kind of co-pilot role on

offense the second dominated with their

team's attack

orbiting around their incredible scoring

which brings us to the final great big

man

in this series was tim duncan more of an

offensive centerpiece

or did his crafty low post scoring game

and suffocating interior defense make

him the very best

of the two-way big men you are watching

what

greatness is all about where's larry

bird in all this

how's it blocked by elijah michael

jordan

saves the day this series tackles one

question

who was the best at his best we started

the aba merger and go through the best

multi-year stretches examining the

legends who provided the most

on court impact these are the greatest

peaks

to me we hit you in phrases got you

almost

this is the worst right here nice try

duncan is easily the best modern

defender never to win defensive player

of the year

his teammate bruce bowen is actually the

only player with a larger share of votes

over the years to never claim the award

and like great defensive centers before

him tim's value comes from protecting

the most important real estate in the

game

the space right in front of the hoop

i've never seen any public record of his

actual wingspan

but duncan was long he was around seven

feet without shoes and had the arms of a

weeping willow tree

this is one of the reasons he blocked so

many shots out of a shooter's

hand he had great feel and timing when

targeting attempts like this kenyon

martin is auditioning for the role of

charles smith here

until kevin willis ruins it with a foul

and here devin george is overcome with

the wild

idea to baptize duncan and notice timmy

use that off arm again to slow down

george and feel out the block

timmy this time it's rob ory trying him

and duncan takes a big step and again

uses his off arm to brace

against him and that swimmer's reach can

do the rest

his strength helps this style of shot

contesting

because he doesn't need to load up to

jump he plows through his man here and

probably catches kobe by surprise

and the big fundamental likely caught

plenty of shooters off guard because he

kept his hands

down when he moved then typically

brought them up when jumping like this

so he was always under control when

sliding over to help in the paint

this steady body control allowed him to

challenge threats in the lane

and then immediately recover into a

second challenge

which is one of the perks of a more

floor-bound approach because he never

jumped himself

out of a play again you'll see his hands

are down

ready to jump but he stays locked and

loaded and his windmill arms meant he

could swivel from one threat to the next

because his rim protection was less

about leaping and more about

timing and that ant like standing reach

duncan's block percentage during the

playoffs in these seasons

wasn't too far from the all-time greats

although his numbers were suppressed

slightly by playing next to another

center when the spurs went to win towers

there was about a 15

reduction in his block rate of course

keeping his hands down and not

out meant he rarely deflected passes and

that made it a touch

easier to slip them around him another

key to duncan's paint defense was his

positioning

he'd sag into the lane an extra step or

two so he didn't have to go far to meet

penetrators

again note the body control to stay down

and he barely needs to jump to swat

it he could stand one step into the lane

using the classic

toe tapping technique to avoid three

seconds and that cut down the distance

to help

off the weak side here he slaps his hips

in disagreement

a rare move in a deep bag of

protestations

some of which were more animated and

some of which were more

subtle performance art although my

personal favorite is the incredulous

stare

i'll bet your money on that one i don't

bet anything i'll go for a hamburger

you got it speaking of reactions

duncan's weren't always

lightning quick george is free here

before he goes

but he's so well positioned it takes one

step to protect the rim

and there was usually a tiny delay

before he started sliding

and the third time was not the charm for

devin

td usually arrived on time but sometimes

that minor delay and reaction speed

led to a bucket but he also didn't need

nanosecond processing because he was

such a big

presence any quick step toward the ball

handler heavily influenced drives

he was even long enough to throw off

floaters from skilled guards

in general duncan was aware of most

threats

after some creative screening he slides

toward the action here

then realizes he needs to help on the

roll man and that is a

tough make here's another storm of ball

screens by the offense

and he plugs up the first roller

realizes he needs to recover to the

second screen

and smothers the ball handler in a great

team

sequence duncan was part of a unit that

choked off opponents at the rim holding

them

well below league average on these high

value attempts

the spurs were most successful with two

centers out there

but even with duncan as the lone

middleman they defended the paint

incredibly well

and in general thrived behind a

defensively oriented roster

this is also where greg popovich

established himself as an

all-time coach throwing in a zone every

once in a while to throw

off opponents and instilling air-tight

schemes

the spurs switch this pick and roll

because amari stodomier is mismatched

with a wing

then duncan can pick up amari behind the

play and manu ginobili is down in a

driving gap and the whole thing's a

clinic

the consistent implementation of these

principles was impressive

a big shows on the pick and roll here

which means the other big in the paint

slides to cover the roller

and wings were always prioritizing paint

help bruce bowen is sealing inside

duncan's man

and then the rotations quickly follow

and it leads to a low percentage

shot with ginobili and tony parker yet

to enter their primes

that spurs roster was lighter on

offensive parts

and instead featured defensive studs

like bowen and an aging admiral

who had his moments in spurts all of

this made the spurs a defensive dynasty

posting some of the best multi-year

stretches of regular season

and playoff defense in league history

san antonio's defense was practically

elite without duncan

holding teams nearly four points below

league average from 2001 to 2004

with him on the bench with duncan

protecting the paint

as an anchor the spurs became an

all-time

defense and he had the ability to plug

up breakdowns with fantastic

saves like this however he did have some

blind spots in his vision

meaning he couldn't always locate the

ball instantly or anticipate danger at

all times

he just completely misses this slip play

that utah like to bust out on occasion

and he could have a little tunnel vision

while on the move this cut isn't really

going anywhere

but he zones out and misses the back

door

and this is almost identical to a play

from last episode

where robinson helps in front of duncan

only tim

doesn't slide over to cover robinson's

man until it's too late

and there's no heroic save duncan played

these spurs pick and roll scheme

reasonably well showing then recovering

to his man

but he was particularly effective

sagging off the dribbler and then using

his length to bother pull-up jumpers

even far out on the perimeter his

never-ending arms caught shooters off

guard

and since he was mobile enough to

venture out a bit and use

that size to keep ball handlers at bay

he was well suited for sagging dropping

coverages against pick and rolls

his lateral movement wasn't really a

strength

and he was slightly vulnerable on the

outside to quickness

on this play he's supposed to slow down

the ball but the sharp change of

direction leaves him in kobe's wake

and that whole twin towers thing was so

effective back then

now while duncan's mobility wasn't great

he was slow to decelerate for instance

he wasn't a liability moving around the

floor during that era

while he could be beaten by quicker

players when guarding the ball

it was rare for big man at the time to

face up on the perimeter

and attack him with speed off the bounce

if anything

the slower more interior based game

amplified some of td's man defense

where his length could really bother

opponents who couldn't stretch him to

the outside

he was also really strong strong enough

not to be completely manhandled by shaq

himself

of course that didn't work every

possession i'm convinced flopping was

the only way to

actually slow down o'neill so

just like we've seen from most of the

big men in this series

duncan's defense was an enormous value

add

the bigger question though is just how

valuable was an offense

run through tim duncan

tim duncan your town the week of

greatness is back at foot locker

no way that's insane

i'm

in contrast to the guard-like approach

we saw last episode from kevin garnett

duncan's offensive game was rooted deep

in the paint like a traditional

center unlike old school centers he was

skilled enough to attack from the

perimeter

he could face and drive all the way to

the hole but wherever he started

duncan was often grinding closer to the

basket with his strength

because he was a contemporary of shaq

few people talked about just how strong

timmy was but he often worked for deeper

position

and powered into his points at 260

pounds

he could hold this low position on the

block and then

swim into a move with force notice how

he dislodges his defender with his

shoulder

to create space for the shot and he

would lead with his

arms on these little half hooks and

turning push shots

watch closely he swivels into ori and

throws his arm straight up through ori's

left arm

into the release this takes great hand

strength and turns his off arm into a

shield again

backing down closer and even though his

man is sitting on the shot

he flares that left elbow for protection

all of these deliberate churning moves

require incredible balance and

sturdiness

he sort of pushes the defender with the

ball before going through him

which takes a velcro grip and

this technique naturally led to the rip

through foul where

duncan picked up a bunch of extra free

throws any time his opponent's arms were

down or when they reached for an exposed

ball

and missed free throws were a big part

of duncan's scoring prowess

his three-year peak and free-throw

attempts falls in the 98th percentile

historically

and unlike shaq that served as an

efficiency booster

since duncan shot 70 from the line

so much of his scoring was about

methodically inching closer to the rim

occasionally he'd try that up and under

and sometimes he throw in this power

spin move where he's squeezing the ball

in a vice

you'll notice he was rarely off balance

so when he spins away from the double

team

all his weight is over that right leg

which helps him finish through

contact when his avenues to the hoop

were cut off

he liked a little turnaround over his

left shoulder

and like so many great post scores he

could also wheel into the same turn

around over his

other shoulder although unlike many

right-handed players

it was rarer to see him turn off this

shoulder

there's a rip-through attempt again and

i wonder if he was more comfortable

shooting these turning left because he

could use that off arm to clear out a

contesting hand

of course because it was a tim duncan

move he would jab step and fake his way

into a little kiss

off the glass every once in a while now

where have i seen that before duncan's

bank shot wasn't actually a huge part of

his game

he called on it whenever he was facing

the basket at an angle like this

but the banker was merely a component of

his larger face up attack

which involved little pull-ups on the

baseline or in the middle of the floor

even duncan wasn't actually a strong

outside shooter

making about 38 of his shots beyond 15

feet during these seasons which landed

him in the bottom third of the league at

the time

i don't know how much more accurate he

was going to the bank on these attempts

he was certainly comfortable jab

stepping and then playing it off the

window

but this was still a flat stroke with a

hitch

some of these were straight out of the

adrian dantly school of

rhythmic up faking

the shot was threatening enough to open

up driving lanes

where he could pump fake repeatedly

until a defender reacted and then head

downhill

there's that strength and body control

to take contact from shaq

while decelerating despite his shooting

struggles

duncan actually had some nice touch on

these slow-motion rumbles to the rim

he wasn't the quickest but he was always

under control and dexterous enough to

flip in

all kinds of little shots his face of

game was aided by a tight handle

that let him put his head down and go

he didn't have the change of direction

to unlock a variety of dribble moves

but he was secure enough to barrel

through players on drives like this

we saw a svelter kevin garnett struggle

to hold that line last

episode all of duncan's high percentage

shot attempts and free throws

made him a strong playoff scorer during

these seasons

stacking up well against most big men

historically

save for the best of the very best using

these playoff numbers

he looks far closer to elijahuan than to

someone like walton

as a scoring hub but there's a little

more to the story

when duncan faced stronger defenses his

scoring wasn't quite as

potent dropping off more than many of

the modern greats

and he had similar struggles in the

postseason he just didn't

play many elite defenses in part because

the spurs were so good

by the way like hakeem duncan took up

basketball later than most

he was a 13 year old swimmer in the

virgin islands when he started

and because of that late start he said

he didn't feel he was ready for the nba

after his junior year at wake forest

when he would have been the number one

pick in the draft

this lack of experience might have been

a reason why he started with some fuzzy

court vision

but he was always an eager student and

willing passer

and in time he figured out what to look

for as an offensive

hub he learned passing reads that

allowed the spurs to stream a ton of

their offense

through him they could dump it to timmy

in the post

and have him attack help by kicking it

to a three-point shooter

or he could wait for the double and find

a teammate

cutting this should look familiar

it's the same kind of inside out offense

that we saw with olajuwon's rockets

and o'neill's lakers on this one he

patiently allows the defense to commit

near the baseline

so the basic kick out is open and man

ginobili made some

big plays in 2003 this is the exact same

set we just saw

only the help comes off the cutter to

the corner so duncan fires it there

nicely for a wide open

look and his towering height

helped him move through these

progressions with high

quick releases when he spotted an open

cutter

he even flashed another walton move the

little jump

pass in tight quarters creating an even

better angle for an express shipment

his best most consistent passes were

probably these structured reads from the

post to cutters or

shooters and estimates of shock creation

peg him slightly behind someone like

kevin garnett

velocity helped the big fundamental

because he didn't really throw to

openings before they emerged

that could have been a touch earlier and

sometimes that made a difference

a key to hitting tight windows is to

anticipate movement

and here there's a lag and he's not

ready to snap it over and by then it's

too

late when he could see a pass in front

of him

he could drop some lovely dimes

robinson's in his line of sight here

and those huge hands make the magic

happen

speaking of magic he was a favorite of

duncan's growing up

and so timmy always wanted to freestyle

like a guard

in transition and there's a johnson

inspired look away

he still had blind spots at his peak

openings and his periphery could go

unnoticed here's another one where the

cut starts out of the corner of his eye

but he's kind of locked into his bank

shot dance

sometimes it felt like once he committed

to a movement there was no going back

he starts throwing this pass without

adjusting for the defender

even though his teammate did and i think

duncan had more of these

glitchy looking turnovers than most

superstars

however slow adjustments don't mean slow

actions and he could certainly map the

floor in front of him when he had a

second to process it

and then move the ball quickly to my eye

he was most comfortable with quick reads

out of set pieces

where he knew what to look for like in a

short roll situation with a teammate in

the dunker spot

he had nice chemistry with robinson in

particular

especially on passes from the top there

was a kind of

big to big simpatico with these lobs to

the admiral

and they even ran a little twin tower

pick and roll with the courts based

unfortunately those were very rare but

it wasn't rare for duncan to hop along

with his front court mate

synchronized swimming style finally

the big fundamental could snap off some

brisk

outlets and he would even try to throw

these over the top when the opportunity

presented itself

which was a nice fit with smaller

players who like to get out and run in

transition

much like walton's blazers san antonio's

duncan-centric

attacks produced pretty good results but

they certainly weren't a team

powered by offense finishing about two

points ahead of the league on that end

from 2001 to 2003.

ironically the o3 title team was one of

the weakest spurs teams

of duncan's prime but a theme of this

series

is the difference between building an

offense around a big man

versus a team around a big man like

walton

garnett and robinson duncan's two-way

impact made him a

superstar and on those teams his post-op

game was a perfect fit for a defensively

slanted roster

that was supercharged by duncan's paint

protection

because of this he has some legendary

plus minus stats during these seasons

posting the second largest point

differential on record when he was on

the court

compared to when he was off the court

trailing only his teammate david

robinson from the preceding three years

while robinson and duncan reinforce the

incredible value of defensive studs

who are offensive all-stars it gives me

some pause that the top two numbers came

from the same team in back to back

periods there's plenty of noise in 50

games of plus minus data

and duncan's surrounding stretches do

look drastically different

there were nagging injuries in those

following years but his scoring numbers

remain the same

part of the plus-minus drop-off was

probably san antonio growing less

dependent on his offense

as players like parker and ginobili

emerged

the spurs became a very good playoff

offense in the mid 2000s

and while duncan certainly wasn't a poor

fit

his brand of slower high viscosity post

scoring

doesn't scale up that well methodical

isolation scoring

can lift a team's offensive floor but

it's hard to be a

great co-pilot with that approach

his lack of outside shooting limited

some of his off-ball value

he could splash in jumpers off a pick

and pop

but he just wasn't that efficient on

these

he was a far better role man where he

could catch and finish through contact

near the rim

and he was mobile enough to take a

dribble and adjust

at the hoop and this kind of off-ball

game

is a key to blending in on better and

better offenses

he added more value with his offensive

rebounding game

although they were often grabbing his

own misses which was also a byproduct of

his

power scoring constantly trying to press

forward toward the basket this is kind

of like a lighter version of what we saw

from shaq

in episode 9. you can also see how

crazy long duncan is here barely jumping

to

reach 10 feet this overall combination

of

scoring shot blocking and plus minus

data

gave peak duncan some of the best impact

metrics on record

and while they might overstate his value

they also drive home how valuable his

archetype can be where duncan's low post

scoring and playmaking

can help weaker offenses reach

respectable heights

while at the same time driving them to

contention with

huge impact on defense and that same

package can turn a solid team into a

title favorite

which is exactly why tim duncan's

two-way impact

gave him one of history's greatest

peaks

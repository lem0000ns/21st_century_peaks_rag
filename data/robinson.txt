[00:00] basketball adonis david robinson
[00:02] generated some of the best regular
[00:04] season numbers
[00:05] in league history he and michael jordan
[00:08] are the only players ever
[00:10] to win a scoring title and defensive
[00:12] player of the year
[00:14] but was he just a paper tiger did he
[00:17] crumble in the playoffs
[00:19] or was he actually a complex
[00:22] multi-faceted superstar
[00:24] and one of the most valuable players of
[00:26] the three-point era are watching what
[00:30] greatness is all about where's larry
[00:33] bird in all this
[00:35] has it blocked by elijah michael jordan
[00:38] saves the day this series tackles one
[00:42] question
[00:42] who was the best at his best we started
[00:46] the aba merger and go through the best
[00:48] multi-year stretches examining the
[00:50] legends who provided the most
[00:51] on-court impact these are the greatest
[00:56] peaks
[01:02] it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
[01:05] understand that he's very special
[01:06] it's ghostly it's not recognizable you
[01:10] think of it as normal quickness but i
[01:12] think it transcends it
[01:14] goes to another level in the 80s we saw
[01:18] some of the greatest offensive players
[01:20] to ever grace the hardwood
[01:21] but robinson was a callback to
[01:24] defensively dominate big men like bill
[01:26] russell
[01:27] in college david's quick leaping drew
[01:29] comparisons to russell
[01:31] it took a millisecond for him to reach
[01:33] 11 feet with a quick hop and his long
[01:35] outstretched left hand listed at 7-1
[01:39] robinson was a good two or three inches
[01:41] taller than russell
[01:42] and his combination of size and jumping
[01:45] speed made him a devastating rim
[01:47] protector
[01:48] nasa should have conducted lab testing
[01:51] on how quickly robinson
[01:53] launched off the floor all he required
[01:55] was a little knee bend to spring up
[01:57] off of two feet and he was almost
[01:59] entirely a two-footed jumper
[02:02] often using a quick hop to organize his
[02:04] feet and then
[02:05] swat here's another look there's the
[02:09] little hop to load up
[02:10] and he's still on the floor when weyman
[02:12] tisdale nears his apex
[02:14] and in less than two tenths of a second
[02:16] robinson arrives above the rim
[02:19] it typically took robinson about six or
[02:21] seven tenths of a second
[02:23] from the time he started his gather to
[02:25] meet the ball above the hoop
[02:27] for comparison this crazy michael jordan
[02:30] block took over eight
[02:31] tenths from his windup and when robinson
[02:33] went directly
[02:34] into his bunny hop to contest he was
[02:37] comparable to rustle himself
[02:39] in time to reach 10 feet throw in
[02:42] robinson's length and he could just
[02:44] materialize out of nowhere
[02:46] like a shot blocking wraith on the
[02:49] offensive end robinson can
[02:51] feel unspectacular his upper body
[02:54] stiffness lacks a certain
[02:55] sexiness for most people but that's
[02:57] because he was a seven foot one bionic
[03:00] human
[03:00] whose best move was just being quicker
[03:03] and more explosive
[03:04] than normal big men despite his height
[03:08] he preferred to turn
[03:09] and face the hoop from the mid-range and
[03:11] go to work out of a classic triple
[03:13] threat position
[03:15] his first step was overwhelming for most
[03:17] opponents
[03:18] and he was strong enough to power around
[03:20] slight contact like this
[03:23] even though it's only one hard dribble
[03:25] he was
[03:26] a boatload approaching the basket with a
[03:29] short runway
[03:30] this face jab and go game was too fast
[03:33] for many fives of the 1990s
[03:36] and it led to a parade to the free throw
[03:38] line
[03:39] robinson's free-throw rates peaked right
[03:41] around jordan's during their best
[03:43] playoff stretches
[03:44] despite david having the ball less than
[03:46] mj
[03:47] and not receiving deliberate fouls like
[03:49] shaq and dwight howard
[03:51] as you can see from that list it's hard
[03:54] for big men to create
[03:55] signature shots when marching to the
[03:57] free throw line constantly
[03:59] but as a 75 free throw shooter this was
[04:02] incredibly effective offense he even
[04:05] threw in his own mini euro step
[04:08] where he'd swing back the other way if
[04:10] he felt his first step
[04:11] cut off they didn't call this pivot foot
[04:13] travel as much back then
[04:15] even though they were stricter in
[04:16] forcing two steps
[04:19] in a sense his physical gifts made
[04:21] robinson the 90s version of
[04:23] giannis antodokupo except instead of
[04:26] attacking from around the three-point
[04:27] line
[04:28] robinson set up shop near the elbows and
[04:30] relied on a quick
[04:31] first step unlike giannis the
[04:35] admiral blended his rim attacks with an
[04:37] effective face up jumper
[04:40] he could fake a drive with that jab step
[04:42] to create space
[04:43] then fire a clean look in the data we
[04:46] have access to at the end of the 90s
[04:48] robinson hit 43 to 44 of his mid-range
[04:52] twos landing him somewhere between the
[04:54] 60th and 75th
[04:56] percentile among volume mid-range
[04:58] shooters this century
[05:00] and he could even drain those off a
[05:02] dribble although he appeared less
[05:04] comfortable
[05:05] moving into his shots like this his
[05:08] outside shot then allowed him to sell up
[05:10] fakes and
[05:11] bee-lined to the rim and that resulted
[05:14] in more lay-ups or
[05:15] trips back to the free-throw line back
[05:18] in those days he was occasionally
[05:19] criticized for playing like this
[05:22] seen merely as a jump shooter who
[05:25] lacked the traditional back to the
[05:26] basket game to dominate like a classic
[05:29] big but remember back to the basket
[05:32] offense
[05:33] isn't incredibly effective unto itself
[05:36] kareem was basically the only big man to
[05:38] spearhead great offenses for the first
[05:40] 35 or 40 years of the shot clock
[05:42] and he did so next to elite guards
[05:45] besides robinson did have a solid low
[05:48] post game
[05:49] too his physical advantages allowed him
[05:51] to power into certain opponents
[05:53] and once again that pressure led to
[05:55] quality looks at the rim
[05:56] or more free throws he also had a nice
[06:00] little fadeaway to his left shoulder
[06:02] and he could flow into this quickly and
[06:04] his size
[06:05] and high release often generated a
[06:08] really clean look
[06:10] by 1995 this shot was fairly polished
[06:13] and he used it quite a bit against
[06:15] smaller defenders who gave him problems
[06:17] like carl malone malone's bodybuilding
[06:20] strength
[06:21] and quick feet prevented robinson from
[06:23] blasting by him
[06:25] and he could hold deep position against
[06:27] david and disrupt his setups
[06:29] despite giving up four inches or so
[06:32] agility and strength were an antidote to
[06:35] robinson's first step
[06:37] and once a drive was walled up he could
[06:39] target the ball with that patented slap
[06:41] down move
[06:41] and in today's jargon he would be an
[06:43] admiral stopper
[06:45] in general biggs who were fairly strong
[06:48] and could move their feet well
[06:49] slowed robinson down by taking away the
[06:52] quickness advantage
[06:53] he held over so many traditional centers
[06:55] of the 90s
[06:57] david could occasionally turn back to
[06:59] that right shoulder
[07:00] but this was a tougher shot for him he
[07:03] doesn't rotate that quickly and so
[07:05] squaring his shoulders to the hoop takes
[07:07] an extra sometimes
[07:08] awkward beat against weaker defensive
[07:11] teams of his era
[07:12] robinson was less likely to encounter
[07:14] match-ups like this
[07:16] but his scoring took a major haircut
[07:18] against stronger defensive teams
[07:20] who were more likely to have versatile
[07:23] big men
[07:24] that six percent drop in efficiency is
[07:26] on the large side for modern superstars
[07:29] and in the regular season robinson was
[07:31] able to juice his scoring numbers
[07:33] a bit more than a typical star player by
[07:35] picking on weaker teams
[07:37] which meant that his peak regular season
[07:39] numbers overstated how effective his
[07:42] scoring arsenal was in a playoff
[07:44] setting now this is still
[07:48] good scoring it's just not great scoring
[07:51] the admiral even threw in a little spin
[07:53] move occasionally
[07:54] but this was also stiffer than versions
[07:56] from other superstars at the time
[07:58] like hakeem olajuwon even robinson's
[08:02] really
[08:02] impressive shots like this turn over
[08:05] olajuwon
[08:06] didn't leave the same mark as akim's
[08:09] crazy
[08:10] high difficult fadeaways and this
[08:12] aesthetic
[08:13] gap helped create the impression that
[08:15] elijah won dominated robinson
[08:17] and was light years ahead of him as a
[08:19] player
[08:20] but that narrative misses a critical
[08:22] part of the story
[08:24] and overlooks robinson's actual value
[08:28] on a high-level team
[08:32] dennis you're just a little bit too
[08:34] tight man you need to loosen up
[08:35] over the top man be an individual so
[08:38] what do you want me to do well you can
[08:39] start by eating your pizza the wrong way
[08:40] crust first after a number of near wins
[08:44] robinson finally grabbed an mvp trophy
[08:46] in 1995
[08:47] and led the spurs to the western finals
[08:50] where
[08:51] he ran into a buzzsaw robinson was
[08:54] tasked with guarding hakeem
[08:56] often without any help and while he
[08:59] defended him fairly well
[09:00] on most possessions a heads-up battle
[09:02] with akeem was a
[09:03] bad match up for the admiral olajuwon
[09:06] had some monster
[09:08] games in their regular season meetings
[09:10] and akeem's quickness could take away
[09:12] robinson's first step
[09:13] well on the other end robinson couldn't
[09:15] really take away his
[09:17] dream shaking and wild shot making
[09:20] robinson was a really good man defender
[09:23] he used his length to contest shots well
[09:26] and he was able to hold his own against
[09:28] the powerful brutes of that
[09:29] era grappling with a young shaquille
[09:31] o'neal here before his quickness wins
[09:33] out for the steal
[09:36] even though he wasn't great moving
[09:37] laterally he was
[09:39] long and springy enough to recover but
[09:41] he was susceptible to
[09:43] up fakes and at times he could be a
[09:45] little too quick off his feet
[09:47] which showed in a number of different
[09:49] defensive scenarios
[09:50] especially near the hoop
[09:53] jumping like this fed into hakeem's
[09:55] hands as a ball faking houdini
[09:58] throwing his dream shakes into robinson
[10:00] and setting him up for
[10:01] memorable scoring highlights combine
[10:04] elijahuan's tough shot making
[10:06] and his own natural quickness and it
[10:08] makes for a lopsided game of one-on-one
[10:11] but that's the thing about robinson he's
[10:14] a good one-on-one player
[10:16] but he's a 5 on 5 star
[10:20] his off ball game was just as if not
[10:23] more important than his isolation
[10:25] scoring
[10:26] his face up jumper made him a viable
[10:29] catch and shoot finisher in the
[10:30] mid-range
[10:31] but more importantly it made him a pick
[10:33] and pop weapon
[10:35] this wasn't the spread pick and roll
[10:37] that is so popular today
[10:38] but the spurs ran plenty of ball screens
[10:41] inside the three-point arc
[10:42] where robinson could pop to open space
[10:45] and knock down
[10:46] positive value shots by 1994 this shot
[10:50] was pretty dialed in for david
[10:52] and he could even turn it into an up
[10:54] fake and go in these situations
[10:57] his athletic gifts also made him a
[11:00] natural finisher around the basket
[11:02] this play against the rockets shows just
[11:04] how easy he could make it look
[11:06] catching the ball 10 feet away and
[11:08] casually gliding by a fleet of defenders
[11:11] without a dribble
[11:13] his athleticism made him a weapon in
[11:15] transition as well
[11:17] where he used his straight line speed to
[11:19] outrun slower
[11:21] burlier centers of his time it's less
[11:24] common today
[11:25] but this penalized bigger lineups who
[11:27] crash the glass
[11:29] and it was normal for robinson to
[11:30] outsprint opponents
[11:32] multiple times in a game like he did to
[11:34] shaquille o'neal
[11:35] in this 1996 matchup
[11:38] david was one of the better lob threats
[11:40] of that era a
[11:42] giant explosive target and that's
[11:44] two-time
[11:45] defensive player of the year alonzo
[11:47] mourning he just
[11:48] rag dolls i do think he was a touch more
[11:53] fluid
[11:53] flowing into these in his first few
[11:55] seasons but lobs were certainly part of
[11:57] his offensive package
[11:59] in those peak years san antonio started
[12:02] to unlock this talent in 1996
[12:05] when they ran more side pick and rolls
[12:07] with avery johnson
[12:09] who grew comfortable with these reeds
[12:11] and i think between his mid-range
[12:13] shooting
[12:13] and his finishing skills robinson would
[12:16] have made a wonderful partner
[12:18] for a high-level pick-and-roll guard
[12:21] instead he was asked to carry the entire
[12:24] offense in the mid-90s which wasn't
[12:27] quite an ideal role
[12:29] the admiral was best suited to anchor a
[12:31] team's defense
[12:32] and play a hybrid role on offense acting
[12:35] as a
[12:36] co-pilot or second best offensive player
[12:40] the exact role he would play after his
[12:43] peak
[12:44] when tim duncan arrived in 1998
[12:47] duncan shouldered a larger isolation
[12:49] load while
[12:50] the flexible robinson played largely the
[12:52] same style out of the high post
[12:55] robinson's off ball skills allowed him
[12:57] to fit in well with another talent
[13:00] where he could still co-anchor some of
[13:02] the offense
[13:03] here drawing a double for a huge three
[13:06] in the title clinching game in 1999
[13:09] and he could mix in his own isolation
[13:11] scoring
[13:12] in more select doses the result was
[13:16] a decrease in volume for robinson with
[13:18] an increase in scoring efficiency
[13:21] a slightly above average offense for the
[13:23] spurs as a team
[13:25] and more importantly a dominant
[13:28] defense behind those twin towers
[13:31] the spurs engineered arguably the
[13:33] greatest defensive stretch in league
[13:35] history
[13:36] holding their playoff opponents about 7
[13:39] points per 100
[13:40] below their regular season efficiency a
[13:43] feat match by
[13:44] only a few teams and those teams had
[13:46] weaker regular season defenses
[13:49] while duncan was a great defender out of
[13:51] the gate
[13:52] it was robinson's impact that led the
[13:54] spurs on defense
[13:55] and while many view duncan as the clear
[13:57] alpha dog on those teams after 1998
[14:01] robinson wasn't far behind because of
[14:03] his two-way
[14:04] impact and ability to blend with duncan
[14:07] on
[14:07] offense robinson was a good entry passer
[14:11] in the mid 90s
[14:12] and his best passes were from the
[14:14] perimeter where he could face
[14:16] up and survey the floor in this position
[14:19] his height
[14:20] allowed him to see the action unfold and
[14:23] he could fire two cutters with decent
[14:25] speed or he could feather in deliveries
[14:27] with a bit more
[14:28] touch he was always a
[14:31] willing extra passer in this 1993 play
[14:34] he can see the court and
[14:36] quickly flips it to a high leverage spot
[14:39] and by 1995 i thought he was better at
[14:42] processing cutting action
[14:44] in front of him this is a really nice
[14:47] read here
[14:47] quickly spotting that his cutter's
[14:49] defender goes behind another laker in a
[14:52] kind of
[14:53] half-hearted tag and while there's no
[14:55] quick shot it's the kind of pass that
[14:57] demonstrates some understanding
[14:58] of what defenses are doing and it shows
[15:01] some anticipation
[15:04] although he wasn't elite in these spots
[15:07] he misses the potential draymond green
[15:08] special here
[15:09] and in my film study i'm not sure he
[15:12] ball faked in a situation like this
[15:14] one time to manipulate the defense
[15:18] here's another one from the same game
[15:20] where he doesn't have time to really
[15:21] process the backside action
[15:23] and misses a potential layup
[15:26] when he couldn't survey the floor the
[15:28] results were choppier
[15:30] he can't quickly process that the corner
[15:32] is open here
[15:34] and with his head down he desperately
[15:36] flails this to an
[15:37] outlet with his back to the basket as
[15:40] long as he could see that help coming
[15:42] from the top
[15:43] his kickout passes were pretty solid and
[15:45] this created plenty of open shots for
[15:47] the spurs
[15:48] when they spaced the floor around him
[15:51] here he
[15:52] turns to spot the help and in trying to
[15:54] locate his teammate the delivery gets
[15:56] away from him a bit
[15:58] here's another one where he can't see
[15:59] the double coming and his instinct is to
[16:01] turn and pass
[16:03] but again it's not the smoothest
[16:04] delivery and it's deflected in front of
[16:06] his body
[16:08] his lack of a handle and that lateral
[16:11] stiffness
[16:12] hurt him in these spots where well-timed
[16:14] double teams could prevent him from
[16:16] quickly moving it
[16:17] and in this case he's clamped up and
[16:19] misses another possible
[16:21] dagger still i think that high post
[16:25] extra passing prowess along with his
[16:27] massive defensive impact
[16:29] was the key to unlocking robinson's
[16:31] value as a defensive superstar
[16:34] and offensive number two from 1998 to
[16:38] 2000
[16:39] robinson logged 37 minutes per game in
[16:41] the playoffs well duncan played 41
[16:43] minutes a game
[16:44] when robinson sat on the bench during
[16:46] those years
[16:47] the spurs were outscored by 16
[16:50] points every 48 minutes but when
[16:53] robinson
[16:54] played they were a whopping plus 11
[16:58] and since we've been tracking this data
[16:59] since 1997
[17:01] that is the largest change among any
[17:04] rotation player on record
[17:06] in the postseason in the 98-99 playoffs
[17:10] the spurs were actually better in the
[17:13] limited minutes duncan was on the bench
[17:15] we're only talking about a few hundred
[17:16] minutes here so there's plenty of noise
[17:19] but this is a huge reminder of how
[17:21] impactful
[17:22] a hybrid player like robinson can be
[17:25] without being the team's clear-cut
[17:27] number one scorer
[17:29] this makes sense when we remember these
[17:31] were dominant
[17:32] defensive teams that were slightly above
[17:35] average
[17:36] on offense it also brings us full circle
[17:39] back to bill russell
[17:41] who as we examined in the series prelude
[17:44] dominated the 60s without being his
[17:47] team's best offensive player
[17:49] i wonder what robinson's career would
[17:51] have looked like with another offensive
[17:53] star next to him
[17:54] and furthermore how would we view him if
[17:57] he was the one who joined a 32 year old
[17:59] duncan in 1998
[18:01] and propelled the spurs over the top
[18:03] launching the popovich
[18:04] era robinson was clearly a better
[18:08] offensive player than russell
[18:09] although despite that incredible speed
[18:11] off the floor and his considerable
[18:13] defensive impact
[18:14] he wasn't entirely on russ's level at
[18:17] that
[18:17] end his reactions to threats were quite
[18:20] quick
[18:21] especially if he could see the threat in
[18:23] front of him but robinson could be a bit
[18:25] too stationary in sub-par
[18:27] positions he wasn't really down in his
[18:29] stance pivoting around a lot like bill
[18:31] walton
[18:32] but i think he didn't bounce around a
[18:34] lot because of his limitations moving
[18:36] laterally
[18:37] his lateral movement wasn't really poor
[18:39] but it was
[18:40] more laborious and stiffer especially
[18:42] compared to his straight ahead quickness
[18:45] and so he couldn't easily slide
[18:47] horizontally in the paint
[18:48] which limited him compared to some of
[18:50] his normal straight line movement in
[18:52] help situations
[18:54] just like we saw in his passing game he
[18:56] wasn't great at mapping the court that
[18:58] he couldn't see
[19:00] and sometimes that allowed breakdowns
[19:01] behind his field of vision
[19:04] pick and roll also wasn't a huge part of
[19:06] the game then
[19:07] but robinson's horizontal movement meant
[19:10] this wasn't really a defensive strength
[19:12] for him
[19:13] and in general he tried to avoid
[19:15] stretching to the perimeter
[19:18] still a strong offensive game and nearly
[19:21] goat defense
[19:23] yields some massive overall impact
[19:26] we have regular season plus minus data
[19:28] going back to 1994
[19:30] and on a per game basis robinson looks
[19:32] like one of the best regular season
[19:34] players we've ever
[19:35] seen using our historical box score
[19:39] estimates
[19:39] his playoff value during these peak
[19:41] seasons looks good
[19:42] but not quite what we'd expect for a top
[19:44] 10 candidate
[19:46] however the admiral moves up a rank when
[19:48] we use his numbers from 1998
[19:51] and we know when we add in plus minus
[19:52] data for those years he looked like a
[19:54] titan
[19:56] this reinforces what the box score can't
[19:59] capture
[20:00] robinson's combination of quality
[20:02] isolation scoring and off-ball
[20:04] offense along with that massive
[20:06] defensive impact
[20:07] make him one of the most valuable
[20:08] players of his era
[20:10] his two-way skill set scales well on a
[20:13] variety of championship
[20:15] rosters and as a result there aren't
[20:18] five
[20:18] centers since the aba merger who i think
[20:21] have peaked higher
[20:22] than david robinson

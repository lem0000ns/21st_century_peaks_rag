you know michael jordan you know his legendary moments you know that fadeaway you know his aerial gifts but do you know what made him unique as a scorer
the ins and outs of his passing game his defensive strengths and weaknesses jordan's mystique grew in the 90s but did he actually reach his peak before he ever hoisted a championship
trophy and were those the best seasons that we've ever seen on a basketball court you are watching what greatness is all about where's larry bird in all this has it blocked by elijah
michael jordan saves the this series tackles one question who was the best at his best we start at the aba merger and go through the best multi-year stretches
examining the legends who provided the most on-court impact these are the greatest peaks he's the best athlete he's one of the best competitors he's one of the most skilled players
and that to me makes him the best basketball player that i've ever seen play in this series we've seen how big men ruled the game for decades and how the offensive brilliance of magic
johnson and larry bird reimagined what taller players could do but there were high flying wings with offensive success in the 60s and 70s too elgin baylor was the first superstar who really attacked
vertically off the bounce then julius irving and david thompson extended that approach as a kid growing up in north carolina jordan idolized thompson who combined an explosive first step with a little
sky walking to finish third in mvp voting in 1978. jordan was the next leap in that evolutionary chain and his incredible first step set a new standard for attacking the rim
when he entered the league michael could just teleport around defenders with his burst able to get around players in just a single step and even though he was a hair slower by
1989 this incredible acceleration was always the foundation of jordan's success he'd burn defenders to the right or to the left with this penetration and he was so quick that blinking was
dangerous joe dumars flinches at a turnaround here and then becomes a turnstile there wasn't anything special about this being a first step it was just mind-bending
acceleration jordan's like a formula one car racing against priuses that acceleration shot him out of a cannon and that speed was a launch pad for his
vertical finishing he's flying by the second step here and that helps him actually fly really the man spent so much time in the air he could have registered a tail number with the faa
some of these drives remind me of a running back turning the corner where he'd take off and get really low then transfer all that energy into his leaping note how his body protects the ball here
as he hovers to the other side of the rim and he leveraged his body as an airborne shield like this especially when jumping off of two feet into contact
michael was strong enough to absorb hits while airborne like this and these physical gifts helped him reach the line at historically prolific rates magic kept defenses off balance with his playmaking
but michael simply overwhelmed them with relentless pressure on the rim his huge hands helped make some of this aerial wizardry possible manipulating the ball in the air on these drives or holding it away from
shot blockers that's near the top of the square on the release and these things were so big that the ball could slip off mid-shot and he could still reset it in his
catcher's mitts like nothing happened of course the hang time also makes this work too contorting and bending his body around bigger defenders in the paint jordan displayed the most fluid body
control of perhaps any player ever slithering around opponents as he floated into a clear shot attempt and we haven't even mentioned his footwork which was balletic at times
allowing him to keep his balance while pivoting around like a top and then that hanging aerial control to still square his shoulders on the shot his legs were kicked out on the foul here
and it didn't matter all that hovering and twisting helped michael's mid-range game too his typical pull-ups were supercharged with that elevation hitting a trampoline and then firing
over defenders and whether he was twisting leaning or stopping on a dime he could square his shoulders and still shoot and this kinesthetic mastery made his famous
dagger against cleveland in 1989 possible where he pumps and hangs but right there squares himself comfortably and strokes it incredible we shouldn't overlook his shooting from the mid-range
either he was an 85 free throw shooter during these years and was a knock down shooter inside 20 feet when given space but he also created space vertically with that leaping
ability changing directions and springing clear for a good look michael didn't make thousands of jumpers with a hand in his face he made thousands by jumping so high his
releases were rarely ever bothered as you've probably noticed his handle was good enough to support sharp cuts and he really liked this low in and out dribble to set up defenders and probe for open space he wasn't an
incredible ball handler but he was good enough to knife around the court and since he could also score at the basket with either hand jordan's robust repertoire made him the
greatest scorer in nba history if we look at three-year playoff stretches and adjust for inflation to 2020 scoring rates jordan scored an astounding 34 points every 75 possessions
on true shooting 7 better than average from 1989 to 1991.

he holds the top nine stretches in postseason scoring rate peaking in the late 80s and early 90s when his explosiveness was still intact
and his mid-range accuracy was dialed in he could always fall back on his most iconic move to fade away you see what i did there sometimes mj would get right into this off the catch and that hang time and separation
created really clean releases he preferred going to his right hand on this move until about 1990 or 1991 when that vintage fade to the other side started popping up more regularly i recommend j kyle mann's
history of the fadeaway for more on this shot since the triangle offense organically generated post-ups phil jackson's arrival in 1991 facilitated more fadeaways for jordan here's a great
counter cut audibling off this route with the defender overplaying him and flashing right back to the low block for the catch and turn michael's agility helped him off ball
too using screens and setting up opponents for sharp changes in direction that freed him up so much of chicago's offense before phil jackson was bringing jordan off picks from the
baseline and since he was comfortable flowing into attacks like this since his college days the activity and principles of the triangle helped harness his off-ball
movement the triangle offense prioritizes balancing the floor and ball movement principles that played right into jordan's strengths as a catch-and-go
scorer while michael could read screens and then flash to open areas well he could also punish ball denial with that quick change of direction and with increased space he was so hard to contain
these back cuts were organic feeling an overplay then darting free to the bucket and his movement meant defenses always had to worry about him he cuts right out of traps like this instead of idling
and even when a teammate misses him those cuts could lead to rebounds all his activity and his athleticism made him an excellent offensive rebounder which is often overlooked because he was
usually doing the shooting but this added additional off-ball value to his game on the other hand his weakness as an off ball player was his three point shooting where he peaked at 34 percent on low
volume it didn't seem to matter if these were pull ups or catch and shoot chances but i do think jordan's release at the apex of his huge jump limited his range to a degree
when the nba shortened the line to 22 feet in 1995 mike made 38 on over 750 attempts before struggling again when the line returned to 24 feet otherwise jordan was such a dynamic
scorer that he flummoxed almost any defense of the time the bad boy's pistons dented him slightly but that's about it and yet despite his otherworldly
scoring gifts he wouldn't have six championships without a huge part of his game that is often overlooked rumors michael jordan is retired faked his own retirement i don't know i
know he loves basketball he's probably playing in his backyard with his kids but i don't think he faked his retirement when michael was younger he was often criticized for shooting into double teams frequently
and while his athleticism was breathtaking his shot selection was questionable at times some of these were really difficult attempts he was so skilled that it's hard to say
he took poor shots per se but mj was frequently doubled or tripled and bypassed wide open teammates for some of these attempts given his high volume shooting there are few players in nba
history who shot into extra coverage while a teammate was open more than michael jordan now without strong three-point shooting teammates back then
missing these spot-up shooters probably didn't hurt that much and more importantly these missed passes were easily outweighed by all of the open shots michael did set up his constant penetration collapsed
defenses into the lane and when he did opt to pass chicago ended up with wide open looks that last play was a jump pass and jordan often went airborne for a shot before checking down
to an open shooter like this that luigi hang time helped him to react to defensive decisions before finally passing the mic to a band mate these jump passes set up more than just
outside shots jordan preferred to hit teammates in the lane and his go-to playmaking move was drawing a defender away from the rim as he hovered then throwing one right to
that vacated spot mike loved this jump and dumped laydown where he drove to the basket and then with the big man stepped up to help found a way to drop it off for a layup
these were some of his best passes and he really dialed them in during the 1991 playoffs when he anticipated these little openings more and used his parasailing ability to exploit them more
consistently however leaving his feet like this caused some issues when he decided not to shoot holding a hot potato while hovering with no clear
outlet when he was in the air like this he was at the mercy of whatever was open he switches to a pass here but there's nothing really there and another problem with passing like this
is avoiding all the contesting arms and hands so many of these balls were deflected and as a result his reactionary jump passes led to a number of his turnovers jordan
rarely anticipated openings as a passer this is a simple lead pass to the streaking horus grant but he had to throw it early and he sees it late and then he thinks better of it here he doesn't realize this teammate is
uncovered and so it's a dubious jumper instead of a layup pass on this one scottie pippen's back door cut opens a lob but jordan sees it after it's free
then fires it and man could pip and pass most of michael's best dimes were more reactive seeing an opening and then whipping it to a teammate despite his reputation he was always a
willing passer and learning more angles and reads over the years helped him drop higher level dimes like this he threw in a bit of manipulation beyond that jump pass
going to the lookaway at times and this is his peak passing in 1991 moving the defender with his eyes then impersonating magic in front of ervin himself jordan was also willing to look ahead
for outlet passes this is one of his better ones and he was a good transition passer dropping a brilliant dime on the break every once in a while too to be fair he missed plenty of good
passes in these spots as well pippin's clear here and flying into the lane that familiar drop off is open in studying pastors over the years the great ones will find about 90 of
these open looks whereas michael connected on them about 66 percent of the time but keep in mind the sheer volume of open chances he carved out by drawing attention away from his
teammates with his perpetual scoring pressure in the playoffs there are no more than five players in nba history who created more shots for teammates than jordan
and if we use the same playmaking estimates from the prior episode michael set up his teammates for an open look and estimated 14 times every 100 possessions a stretch only bested by the game's top
offensive engines from the last 15 years and so while jordan was revered for winning 10 scoring titles he was one of the all-time playmaking machines
in league history that raised a weak roster and carried a strong one later on from 1985 to 1989 before scottie pippen emerged and the triangle took hold the bulls offensive efficiency was only around league
average there was only so much michael could do as the lone offensive force on a defensively constructed roster pippin's emergence gave the bulls another elite finisher and secondary scoring weapon
but more importantly another playmaker scotty's passing is historically under discussed and he was a deadly grab-and-go player either finding layups in transition or doing the damage himself as he came
down the lane pip was also one of the all-time great wing defenders and that along with his unselfishness made him a near perfect complimentary piece next to
michael jordan himself improved as a passer at the end of the 80s and into the 90s and with better teammates the bulls roared to some of the best offensive seasons
on record right behind magic's lakers and while we think of magic as having everything run through him on offense michael's combination of scoring and playmaking
gave him one of the highest offensive loads in playoff history while jordan's passing highs were mixed with some blemishes his defense was even more boomer bust the highlight reels where he's flying
all around the court overlook all of his strikeouts and instead focus on his impressive home runs for instance jumping passing lanes like this might produce his most valuable
defensive plays these interceptions could be huge pick sixes that went the other way for easy points and at times jordan was like a cornerback sitting on a passing route
with elite closing speed in 1989 thai aficionado and coach doug collins busted out a half court trap at times allowing mj to size up cross court passes and then turn them into easy offense but
these gambles whiffed as well michael would sell out for them frequently and in this case he can cover this kick out pass here but is going for more with the steal and that can lead to wide open looks
by my eye jordan hit pay dirt more often than not but there was a tax to pay for these steel attempts he could get in passing lanes without gambling reacting quickly in short space
with the defensive equivalent of his first step this is a bread and butter cross screen of the era and jordan not only switches it but pounces like a black cat
and he could shoot the gap with that burst this passes airborne for less than half a second and well michael's airborne for more than half a second michael's quickness helped him keep
smaller shifty point guards in front of him and on the outside he could churn his feet while swiveling his hips to the dribbler in textbook fashion for instance he often guarded isaiah thomas during the
bad boy battles and mj's acceleration allowed him to recover laterally at times and his combination of size strength and agility held isaiah below his normal scoring
numbers in those matchups but that kenny rogers gambling was part of his man defense too michael would backpedal to recover a lot and his preferred move there was to
swipe down for the steal as he slid in front of a dribbler there was a lot of swiping actually spamming the y button at times and plenty of them connected but they
also gave opponents openings that would have been way harder to find if jordan had just played it straight up when he wasn't swiping at the rock he was reaching first on joe dumars here
then another reach around for the steal he lunged for steals a lot on the block like this and here that lets the smaller brian shaw turn clear for an easy look mj did flick plenty of balls this way
leading to deflections or turnovers man but he was usually overly aggressive with this move lurching at air not once on this play but twice leading to a layup he brought those same
habits to the post the swipe down move or a little flick and while he stripped opponents some time i think he was better off playing straight up against post players and using his
athleticism and strength to contest against our old friend magic in the 1991 finals jordan gambled and then gambled and then gambled and was absolutely torched by the bigger
johnson in the post on occasion chicago sent a second defender and you know what happened another defensive gambit jordan loved was the surprise double team where he ambushed unsuspecting players
and let those giant hands pickpocket people as carl malone knows all too well these well-timed sniper shots worked against the deliberate post-ops of the 80s and 90s of course there was a
small price to pay when he couldn't cash in on these because it left his mark wide open without structured rotations and even after this play turns into a more standard trap
it's jordan's man who was wide open the whole time on the other side of the court michael just had an unquenchable thirst to make plays on defense back then he's guarding a shooter here but drifts
into the paint looking for action and that was randy whitman's fourth straight jumper jordan lurked like this because he did make a ton of plays from the paint one of his favorites was swooping in at
the exact moment post players were shooting and mj was one of the best shot blocking guards of all time able to leverage that athleticism to hang and reach
shots and this gave him a level of rim protection that most guards couldn't match these saves at the hoop were high value plays and that defies physics you would be floating above the ground never touching
the surface even with a little less verticality by 1990 or 91 he could still fly in and save the day this play from 1989 demonstrates the big payoff of jordan lurking near the lane
he's able to stop a dunk and this quick reaction and elevation would be elite even for a big man those aerial superpowers even allowed him to protect the rim from behind
he served as a backstop here by flying in from the free throw line on this incredible rotation i don't know about you but i find jordan's high-risk defensive style to be difficult to evaluate
if we look at our historical impact metrics he's right at the top of the heap with a nice lead in my box plus minus model but it's difficult for stats like these
to handle defense well and what we really care about is overall impact so the team here at thinking basketball comb through nearly 200 old jordan games
to calculate his plus minus and give us a better picture of his impact in the playoffs from 1989 to 1991 jordan's bulls were outscored by 12 points every 48 minutes when he sat on the bench but they
outscored opponents by 8 points when he played there's some noise in stats like these but chicago's 20-point increase with jordan in the game would rank 9th since the league began
tracking this in 1997 which puts him up with the all-time results but certainly doesn't separate him from the pack as we've seen he was quick to rotate most of the time
here the play unfolds rapidly and michael jumps on the threat but i wouldn't say he had great help awareness he's late recognizing this despite a teammate pointing it out
and he could become momentarily preoccupied with action in front of him forgetting to rotate for a second he was a strong enough defensive rebounder as a guard that it probably added some value to his
defensive game and given all of his defensive strengths and weaknesses i view him overall as a strong all-league defender but not quite an all-time defensive wing
there are still larger questions to think about here how would he fit next to a post player who wanted the ball more are there diminishing returns next to a ball dominant star
and what's his legacy look like if scotty pippen never emerged what's undeniable is that jordan was the first perimeter player to dominate with mega scoring and play making which puts him in the
conversation for greatest offensive player ever and given his defensive impact it's easy to see why michael jordan is often considered the greatest basketball player
of all time

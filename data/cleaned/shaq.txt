in the last two episodes we've seen two-way big men dominate in the golden era of centers but the last goliath of that era was the biggest shaquille o'neal o'neill was quite
simply the most physically overpowering athlete in the history of basketball or maybe any sport he was more nimble than players he outweighed by 100 pounds and in his apex
there was far more to his game than just bullying people under the rim but what were those other pieces and were they enough to make him the best offensive big man
greatness ever all about where's larry bird in all this has it blocked by elijah michael jordan saves the day this series tackles one question who was the best at his best we start at the aba merger and go
through the best multi-year stretches examining the legends who provided the most on-court impact these are the greatest peaks now i've never seen that when he entered the league in 1993 shaq
was already a 300 plus pound physical marvel before o'neill wilt chamberlain was the benchmark for power on the court but shaq took things to a whole new level after his rookie season
they actually needed to shack proof the baskets and by his peak years in los angeles he tipped the scales at around 340 pounds his power game actually started without
the ball we rarely think of off ball movement like this but o'neil created advantages by working for an extra three or four feet that made all the difference
with the ball in the wing shack flashes to the post but is doubled so moving it to the top creates an easier entry and notice o'neill sit down and drive backwards at an angle to get deeper
same position here only reggie miller sags to prevent a pass to shaq but o'neill sneaks a step or two closer to the goal and so when it's swung to the corner shaq again seals himself deeper to set
up a dunk this was decidedly different than wilt who often parked himself in a spot and waited in a fairly upright position for an entry
right here he could seal bill russell under the rim but in general he wasn't looking for positional advantages like this and while some of this is specific to an arrow with less bully ball in general
it's also a difference in philosophy when shaquille moved across the lane he was trying to get closer to the rim wilt would move more toward the ball he doesn't duck in front of his man but instead flashes to a spot like a finesse
player take ball reversals for example this is ok position but changing sides allows shaq to get a quarter step and then chisel out a much deeper catch and that's unstoppable to prevent
o'neill from getting that step savior defenders took away his cut but then reversing sides opened a new door because he was such a massive target these counters are similar to perimeter
players cutting back door off and overplay only shaq's counters were about grappling for position in the paint and he's sprightly enough to make catches like this
if teams tried to overplay the baseline he could spin out the other side for the lob remember his defender is worried about shaq getting inside that low leg to the baseline
where it's game over if he seals him off yet o'neill's quick enough to punish that overplay in an instant with those light tap-dancing feet this is some basketball jujitsu feeling
more weight on his right leg and then rolling off to go time up the lob this explosive lateral athleticism is often overlooked in shack moving quickly at oblique angles
was the basis of his power game he would drive through his victims from the hips to overpower them with angles wilt didn't have that same low base explosiveness to spin or pirouette quite like o'neill his
footwork was stiffer and he lacked the handle to set up these moves whereas shaq's agility combined with his weight carved out so many of his easy buckets shaq unleashed violence from the floor with
his trunk and massive lower body wilt has said he was sensitive to being seen as a mere brute at the time but shaq leaned into this power as a way to displace opponents before he even
jumped chamberlain was strong enough to have this effect too moving players with his lower body but it wasn't the norm for him like it was shaq who bullied players onto their
heels like a basketball yokozuna turning 260 pound tim duncan into a pinata to set up this drop step o'neill had some finesse too he's setting up the drop step but dikembe mutombos stays square with him so
shaq switches to the fade this was a go-to move for him for years often spinning to the baseline like this and because of his seven and a half foot wingspan and jumping ability he could fire this over giant defenders like
arvida's sabonis he also had surprising range on this shot not quite to the foul line we'll get to that in a minute but out to about 12 or 13 feet while he liked the drop step or
that little turn around to his right he also had a jump hook over the other shoulder he's denied here on his cut across the lane which triggers that ball reversal but dale davis stays with him well and
shaq just falls back on a huge jump hook it certainly was no sky hook shaq thought that shot was uncool but it was hard to defend given his size and speed off the between his hooks powerful spins and
fadeaways shaq was an all-time great playoff scorer at his peak he posted some of the best adjusted numbers in league history trailing only michael jordan in number
of stretches at this volume and doing so on similar efficiency i do think shaq added a different dimension with his off-ball game he racked up nearly 750 makes from close range in his mvp season
an outlier since those records have been kept back to 1997 and about two-thirds of those shots were assisted by teammates which lands him between the 75th and 80th percentile historically
during the lakers repeat shaq didn't even attempt a shot outside of 15 feet in the playoffs and nearly half of his shots came right at the rim so he
lived off a diet of the highest percentage attempts in the sport he added even more value without the ball as an offensive rebounder his low post positioning battles organically segued
into offensive rebounding position here comes that cut across the lane it's jammed nicely but jackson lingers to double shack so now sam perkins has to help off him and the bull is loose
in the china shop some of his prowess on the glass was just wedging himself near the hoop and out jumping people his 7-7 wingspan helped here and so did his incredible springiness
for someone that size and he cleans up this mess with the sledgehammer again check out his feet on this play and how his twinkle toes let him reset into a bunny hop
multiple times it was almost unfair to be so nimble at that size and boxing him out was unenviable and the shack proof basket works teams tried all kinds of tactics in the 2000 western finals
portland went with the tag team holding method but even those kinds of tricks weren't foolproof okay that's not right let me hear you say that ain't right it ain't right that blazers team was
really the only defense to slow down o'neill during the three-peat years swarming him regularly behind the giant arvida sabonis who was about seven foot three and three hundred pounds himself
sabonis had the mass to keep shaq from completely overpowering him and the basketball iq to overplay that baseline move he loved he also tried to deny shaq's cut across the lane
making him catch it three or four feet farther out and that makes a difference versus the diesel a more realistic way to slow shack down was to
foul him there's the traditional method where he's in close or the legendary hackashack where teams intentionally fouled him at the end of the quarter it often felt like shaq was playing on a
nerf hoop and the downside of that was at the line he shot a nerf ball i've never understood how deliberately fouling a 53 free throw shooter was a winning play that would be
great half court offense back in those days although when shaq was powering up next to the hoop 53 was way better than the 75 or so he shot at the rim because of this he put entire front
lines into foul trouble forcing playoff teams to keep unskilled bruising bigs on their bench just to buy minutes against him so shaq's attack warped the entire game
like few players ever have but were the other elements enough to make him the best center ever birthday present shaquille o'neal who turns 27 tomorrow not bad
that's it from the forum i'm lauren sanchez back to you part of the benefit of shaq's positional sparring is that it led to quick hitting catch and shoot plays or in his case maybe i should say
catching dunk plays and by scoring immediately he didn't take away many opportunities from teammates by monopolizing the ball if shaq wasn't in a position to catch and go one
card he could play was the repost giving the ball up to find that superior position without dribbling this was a natural bridge between his scoring and playmaking where if he felt a double team in these
spots he quickly kicked it out and could re-post but if that didn't lead to deeper position he'd play the same game again he was quite patient in these situations
waiting for defenses to commit to blitzing him and he would move it to the direction the help came from to punish them if the double drop down from the top
shaq surveyed and comfortably tossed it back out to a teammate if it came from the opposite corner right away he looked to that corner and in general he was really good at attacking the
location of a double team alan iverson doubles off a different laker and shaq gashes it and then still cleans up the play himself with that rebounding he could work his way through
progressions too here's a double from the top but new jersey shifts its defense to take away the basic kick out so shaq looks to the cutter and that's picked up well
which leaves the skip pass to the opposite wing notice how he swivels his head when he catches an entry so he can see the action unfolding and find the optimal play
and his processing speed in these spots was quite strong he spots the double before he lands here and then holds the defender with a no look pass again watch his head
before the ball hits his hands he's surveying the floor so he knows the lane is open if his cutter has half a step and hooks up robert ore with perfect touch on a bounce pass
shaq was willing to try tighter passes in the paint like this he sends this to open space in the middle of the lane with a little hop and a soft touch shaq was right hand dominant as a passer
treating the basketball like a dodgeball and that led to some limitations or awkward deliveries at times he would occasionally throw one too hot or miss his target like this
although he also had some brilliant deliveries too this looks like a skip pass but it's a change up that drops perfectly to a cutter and on this play he sees iverson fall asleep
and those giant hands make this touch pass an easy bucket some speedy neurological processing also helped him audible at times he's flowing into a catch and shoot here
but switches to a pass at the last second after spotting a double and as coach byrd can attest to that is just too good for my money shaq is the best low post passer among
the great 90s centers but there were some holes in his vision he could miss openings on the opposite block he threads it once he sees horus grant but a great pass
arrives two seconds earlier here's that same action again over shaq's left shoulder and he's blind to it and this is a connection that excellent postpassers make most of the time
similarly he could also miss the baseline cut from the same side of the court and i think this is the trade-off of conditioning himself to spot the double team instead of holistically reading the
floor he misses the easy layup here but is quick to hit a spot up shooter since he was quick to react to doubles his teammates had some wide open threes this is similar to what
we saw last episode with akeem's rockets where surrounding him with capable shooters punished double teams and dotting the ark with these players and even a stretch four optimized shaq's inside out value
outside of a white hot playoff run in 2001 those lakers were never really a good three-point shooting team but they had enough respectable shooters on the court to space the floor
and keep defenses honest which allowed a more defensively slanted supporting cast to play off shaq while maintaining those offensive heights as a result la's attacks were very good in the regular season
and all-time good in the playoffs able to maintain their regular season efficiency against those super stingy playoff defenses of that era because almost no one had a
way to slow down these shack centric offenses with shaq on the bench the lakers playoff offensive rating dropped by nearly 12 points during those three-peat runs to about
98 points per 100 even a young kobe bryant couldn't carry that kind of roster with a replacement level center subbed in for shaq although froby was a great fit next to
o'neill he was already an elite offensive wing who could play make and generate his own shots with shaq probing for position teams were less likely to throw defensive attention
toward kobe who already had a bevy of isolation scoring moves to unleash and because of shaquille's off-ball activity he didn't take away many touches from bryant o'neill fit
incredibly well next to penetrators like this because his defenders were so reluctant to leave him near the hoop and this gave kobe a little more air space when attacking the cup when biggs were forced to help it freed
up shaq on the glass for cleanup duty what a ridiculous duo they were i also think there was a strong fit on defense especially when bryant was at his defensive peak in the year 2000. shaq could be statuesque at times not venturing far from the lane and often dropping deep on pick and rolls and kobe's ability to chase ball handlers over screens and at times hound guards at the point
of attack shored up o'neal's stationary defense and the diesel could be stuck in neutral for entire possessions he stretched that three second rule on both ends and despite kobe's ball denial
on iverson here they still give up an open jumper there were a bunch of reasons why shaq just camped out in the key a lot first his defensive strength was protecting the rim
especially against smaller wings who challenged his massive frame and his giant reach and when he was loaded up and in position to contest he could get to shots like this quickly second he was conserving energy it takes
a lot to move 340 pounds around the court and shaquille was asked to play 43 minutes per game in the playoffs at his peak and in his condition he lacked the motor
to do that while stepping out to the perimeter on defense or even sitting down in a stance and moving more in tight spaces there were a number of instances where
he was slow getting back in transition jogging down the court at a leisurely pace and in some instances he never really made it back into the play and in their playoff matchups the kings
had some success running him until fatigue kicked in also shaq parked himself in the paint because his change of direction wasn't swift enough to make recovering easy and he wasn't
fast enough to help down from the outside like the last two centers in this series on offense he could dictate where all that mass went but having to react on defense
wasn't as easy he's not agile enough to toggle around here smoothly and kind of bear hugs his man and ends up on the wrong side of the play all this was compounded by inconsistent
awareness where on some plays he was a bit slow to read potential threats and on others he was sort of asleep at the wheel with a play unfolding in front of him
this shows up when we look at how opposing teams shot at the rim when o'neill was on the court opponents shot slightly worse than average in 2000 and at exactly average in 2001 which is a far
cry from elite defensive big men like the spurs twin towers or the georgetown centers on the plus side teams didn't take too many of these high percentage shots in the restricted area
against o'neill probably due to his intimidation in other words there was some benefit to him lingering in the lane many opponents didn't want to challenge shaq's shot blocking
or take the physical punishment he could dish out on hard fouls on occasion he would shift into fifth gear and string together really active defensive possessions
leaving the paint moving his feet and giving us a glimpse at what his defense would have looked like with a high revving motor of course most of the time he roamed
around the lane like a grazing elephant so teams with jump shooting big men would punish him on the perimeter shack did not want to switch onto wings and was reluctant to come out on them here la sends extra help and it leads to
a clean three and teams would go at him in pick and roll leaving his teammates on an island against the screener and ball handler and shaq's reluctance to venture out
helped allen iverson in his famous 2001 outburst and the ultimate example of this was mike bibby's pull-up jumper parade in the 2002 western finals that nearly unseated the lakers this also made it
really easy for big men to pick and pop their way into wide open jumpers so when teams started torching la like this they would bring shaq up to the level of the screen
where he could contest pull-ups this was actually a major tactical adjustment in that big game 7 comeback in 2000 against portland and there's one of those high-energy defensive possessions
note that most of these shots then were long twos because there weren't many pull up three practitioners in the league at that point in 2000 and 2001 the lakers posted
a 103 defensive rating without shaq on the court slightly ahead of league average with him they were about 2 points better and more complex adjustments for teammates and opponent quality
view him as a solid positive on defense in those seasons although not a star we see a similar story looking at his missed games the same method we used back in episode 2 where in 25 contests as the only starter
missing la was almost a 500 team but when shaq returned to the lineup they played at a 62-win pace most of that change was on offense equally as impressive is how the lakers
fared without kobe in those years in 29 games where he was the only starter missing la played at a 54 win pace with an offense nearly three points ahead of the league
and that's without a playmaker replacing bryant a testament to shaq's offensive floor raising with a three and d roster similarly one number impact metrics rank him among the all-time greats
primarily because of his offensive value to me there's enough value from that paint protection for him to be a decently positive defender he was even somewhat effective as a man defender during those years
just based on his size and sheer athleticism and the overall nature of his offense which was off ball quick hitting and so difficult to slow down
made him unique among big men in nba history and gives him a strong argument as the most dominant big man ever

many people view hakeem alajawan's two championships in the middle of the 90s as a kind of interim title belt on rent while michael jordan swung away at curveballs but maybe hakeem should have been in the
best player conversation before jordan retired maybe his dazzling scoring repertoire unlocks something special in the playoffs and maybe that incredible defense made him one of the very best players
of the three-point era you are watching what greatness is all about where's larry bird in all this has it blocked by elijah michael jordan saves the day this series
tackles one question who was the best at his best we start at the aba merger and go through the best multi-year stretches examining the legends who provided the
most on-court impact these are the greatest peaks i was playing other sports soccer volleyball philadelphia i jump more of all around athletes but the coach was telling me that basketball
is your game hakeem's defensive highlights have the grandiosity of some nfl films montage no one at nba history recorded boar block shots than a cable lager won even though he was closer to 610 than a
true seven feet his incredible combination of athleticism and timing made him feel like a very tall oliver khan on the basketball court this sequence
epitomizes how impregnable he could be at the rim scottie pippen turns the corner with dream pulled up top and otis thorpe has no chance against the explosive pippen
but when chicago runs this with hakeem as the low man elijahwan spits the dunk back in scotty's face and pippin has a runway and is above the square
and he still goes and gets it it's not any easier trying to glide around hakeem because that long right hockey stick finds the basketball as he twists in the air the first cornerstone of his shot
blocking brilliance was his accuracy targeting the ball with that domineering right hand notice the hand tracks with the path of the ball as it shot even in his younger days when he
was slightly less polished he was incredibly accurate targeting the rock and growing up as a handball player primed him to zero in on the ball like this
hakeem didn't play basketball in nigeria until he was about 16 so it was really volleyball that groomed his jumping technique he'd patiently prepare to spring up and wait till the precise moment
to commit to a shot he holds until sean elliot's airborne then spikes this thing this is subtle and requires great reflexes but when alejand moved around the paint he was constantly ready to
jump which allowed him to attack after a shooter left his feet it's on display here where he slides over to contest but when elliot hesitates hakeem shuffles his feet into a new
jumping position and sends it back in his face this is an incredible skill allowing him to slide into position for a save yet he doesn't jump
instead controlling his body and waiting for the moment the shooter finally puts it up he probably learned some of this playing his third major sport growing up soccer where fittingly he played
goalkeeper foreshadowing his career as the nba's all-time leader in blocks hakeem registered at least five blocks in 35 of his playoff games from 1986 to 1994
and in those last two years had five in nearly half of his postseason contests when he was younger he was more of an athletic force but still fairly raw since he picked up
basketball at such a late age and by 1990 his defensive techniques were more polished and he still had that whirlwind athleticism but his 1993 season blended some
sage tricks with his incredible body control that was so rare in someone his size for example hakeem learned to lurk closer to the ball than most big men of the illegal defense era you see joe klein point here because
elijah won should be above the foul line but dream was so quick to the ball he was rarely called for these violations with david robinson at the top of the key akeem loads to the ball at the edge of the
legal boundary the bottom of the little circle so his quick reaction time can erase a layup this subtle positioning was especially valuable on the weak side
he's not glued to robinson and was always tracking the ball ready to materialize at the rim uh poor sean elliott elijah one's quick help was a nightmare for opponents
who were reluctant to shoot when he went into fly swatting mode with that right hand he tracked threats well and was so quick to come into the lane and suffocate any attempt around the basket
when akeem went to the bench opposing teams could finally breathe all of a sudden those high percentage shots around the hoop felt much easier back in the game he swarmed to
the ball even with his man up high and that response speed generated more high leverage contests than any contemporary that i've tracked he didn't get to every threat he pounces
on this back cut but it's a touch too late and every once in a while he missed a cutter coming through the lane but he was usually quick to rotate plugging up gaps in the back line
although by 1995 he was a bit slower sometimes arriving late on these save attempts from outside the paint and a slightly slower motor meant he wasn't itching to jump
at everything on command hakeem's agility helped him defend the perimeter too for one he was rarely ever attacked by wings on switches they also didn't run as many
pick and rolls in the 90s as they do today and coverages weren't as developed then yet he was still comfortable stepping out and taking on smaller players in these
spots without too much of a price to pay on this 1993 play hakeem realizes there's too much space between him and the ball so he closes it quickly then sort of lingers near the lane so he can blow up
another shot attempt here he blitzes the ball handler to completely blow up the play although maybe he's too overzealous hounding the dribbler into the backcourt still this fantastic mobility allowed
him to erase weaknesses in these outdated ball screen coverages he's really low and lunges at the ball from this crouch then somehow slides back to contest
he's hugged up to shaq on this pick and roll but that fluid footwork shifts him into position so he can seamlessly transition from sliding to jumping and preternatural timing stamps the layup
the culmination of olajuwon's volleyball timing soccer agility and handball accuracy led to the most important block of his career this jon stark shot is for the title
in 1994 hakeem slams on the brakes then somehow recovers backwards and times this leap off the wrong foot to save the season this matrix recovery looks half impossible but he does somehow block it
to force a seventh game that houston would go on to win in large part because of olajuwon's offense which may have been even more gravity bending than his defense
i remember one time i gave him a bow and he just laughed nice nice nice elbow brother and then he came out and gave me and by shaq means the dream shake hakeem's twirling array of head fakes
and spins that set up so many of his moves his blend of size and balletic footwork made him a deadly isolation weapon and these were skills he possessed early in his career
drilling crazy fadeaway jumpers or faking one way to freeze defenders and then spinning for a jump hook that agility and balance gave him an edge over most bigs of that time but shot selection was an issue in those
early days launching into triple teams at times and in other cases just firing deep jumpers early in the shock clock by 1993 hakeem's scoring game was more
polished and under control carving out shots like some sort of basketball ballerina all of his moves flowed together which made them so difficult to slow down a spin one way then back the other
throwing up fake and then a hook from there he could fake the hook to set up his fade away to the opposite shoulder and at around 250 pounds he was able to pivot with power
and find clean shots in traffic even double teams couldn't always stop his fade away because he could twist and contort into the shot comfortably and dream could also face up from the
perimeter and wheel his way into those michael jordan once called him a seven foot guard because hakeem's handle was secure enough to drive into open space and that quickness was a challenge for
most opponents who worked really hard just to keep up only to be juked right into highlightville after all of that big men still had to worry about his
spin oh that is so nasty hakeem's array of pirouettes and dizzying pump fakes crescendoed in the 1995 western finals against david robinson who was often left on an island to
defend him inviting akeem to shoot into that single coverage this series wasn't actually that different from olajuwon's normal scoring these years there were a number of those savage fade
aways some of which were still really difficult and didn't always go in along with an assortment of drives up fakes spins and hook shots a lack of double teams made life
easier for akeem who obviously welcomed the chance to dance with robinson in an isolation game alajawan is one of the few players who improved his scoring numbers in the playoffs
and from 1993 to 95 he was just behind the all-time scoring juggernauts in volume while scoring on positive efficiency as a primary scorer he compares favorably to
other contemporary big men however the brilliance of akeem shot making was a double-edged sword these moves were difficult for defenses to take away without hard double teams but they also were hard shots to make
most players manufacture easy points against weak defenses but are forced into harder low percentage shots against elite ones but akeem's attempts were already difficult in the first place
he just made a bunch of them and since he could generate these shots almost on demand stronger defenses couldn't really take away his scoring because he was already taking those hard shots
this kind of resilient or inelastic scoring meant elijahuan's numbers weren't dented that much when he faced stiffer defenses compared to other players in this series
elijahuan shows some of the smallest change among volume scorers when facing high-end defensive teams versus facing weak defensive teams one way to limit hakeem's scoring was by sending
effective help that forced him into a pass he was dangerous enough that defenses frequently doubled him and that created plenty of outside shots for teammates but elijah won was
not a natural passer his instinct was to catch and immediately shift into a scoring move which is why he jacked up so many wild shots when he was younger in 1993 hakeem said he finally grew
comfortable trusting his teammates to knock down their open shots and coach rudy tomjanovich implemented a more elashawon centric offense with shooters around hakeem in a
kind of spoken wheel model he was more patient in spots allowing the defense to commit to a double team before making a decision and this substantially helped his playmaking during these years by
punishing defenses with some basic passing instead of his own scoring his balance and body control allowed him to flow from his scoring dance steps into passes if he felt too much pressure
this is a stark contrast to robinson in the last episode who could get locked up by hard doubles hakeem on the other hand easily segued from a dream shake to a pass this helps replace some
difficult shots with passes he misses a teammate in close but at least finds the open shooter and here he feels the double misses a more advanced interior pass but still calmly kicks it to a teammate
now even in those years olajuwon still took his fair share of double team shots where he left shooters stranded his instinct to just catch and immediately look to score was still strong even at his peak
but i think a bigger weakness was a lack of vision this looks like it's in his periphery but he misses it and he rarely ever hit these kinds of passes it's still there when he shoots
some of this was a byproduct of playing with his back to the basket and not turning and surveying the court but elijah wasn't someone who mapped the floor or kept an eye on advantages like this
his primary focus was reading the double team and here he spins away from it and loses track of where his teammates are to be fair he could hit passes if he felt an extra defender on a drive and he certainly had the athletic
dexterity to drop dimes in those situations still more of his passing was out of the post and the results from there were certainly mixed maximizing akim's
playmaking really required shooters who were spaced around the three-point arc and this likely raised his offensive value in 1995 when the nba shortened the three-point
line higher percentage shooters amplified akeem's playmaking by charging more for those double teams in the post in 1995 the rockets set a new nba record
for threes in a season making nearly eight per game at 37 percent then in the playoffs they were closer to nine threes per game at a hefty 39 the record they broke was held by the
1994 rockets who made five a game in the regular season and then nearly seven at 36 percent in the playoffs and you'll never guess who held the playoff record before that
the 1993 rockets they made five per game at 37 percent some of those playoff percentages might be boosted by hot shooting but playing inside out was clearly the viable way to construct an offense
around olajuwon and the results were pretty good but not great the shortened line in 1995 made this a more attainable strategy basically doubling the number of legit
35 three-point shooters in the league overnight but houston's offense wasn't great because of akeem's passing limitations he didn't look for extra passes like this naturally and so it's unclear how
he would fit next to another offensive star the other tools were there to fit next to a playmaking perimeter weapon first he was a really solid mid-range
shooter and that allowed him to play the pick and pop game effectively dream was nimble enough to move into some of these shots and the data we have on his long twos near the end of his career
suggests he was fairly efficient from the outside he wasn't as big and explosive as someone like robinson either as a lob threat or headed downhill but his agility made him a strong
finisher and this meant he was always a scoring threat as a role man using his gracefulness to carve out finishes near the rim furthermore hakeem was also a fantastic offensive rebounder
some of this is related to his shot blocking where he could move and jump in one motion the other part is that he just constantly pursued the ball on misses and all those jukes and shakes along
with his physical strength made him a pain to keep off the offensive glass he was particularly dangerous sneaking in from the perimeter swimming past two players here to steal
shaq's board so the building blocks were certainly there for alajuan to play a fairly effective off-ball role it's just a question of how many post touches and hero ball shots he was
willing to forgo his defensive prowess alone makes him interesting to build around because in theory he guarantees his team a passable defense and with the right pieces he can anchor
an elite one before hakeem's defense started to slide in 1995 those first two tomjanovich teams held opponents about four points below their regular season efficiency
in the playoffs that's around the 70th percentile historically which is impressive for not fielding a defensively slanted team like detroit's bad boys or the twin tower spurs
some of this impacts stem from mckeem's man to man defense his shot blocking instincts made shooting around him tricky while his agile feet kept quicker big men in front of him
his balance and timing gave post players a ton of trouble which stood out in the 1994 finals against patrick ewing ewing struggled to find any clean shots when isolated against olajuwon
and ended up posting an unheard of 39 true shooting in that seven game series hakeem had incredible hands too probably from the handball and one of his defensive tricks when guarding the post was to
time up a quick push flick once his man started dribbling sometimes just getting the ball to the post was a chore against him because he gobbled entry passes better than
just about any center ever he was constantly repositioning himself into a slight overplay to take away the passing angle then quick enough to toggle back to the other side in a bait and switch
all of his handsiness produced historically great steel rates among big men he posted eight of the top 100 seasons in steals per possession including the highest on record in 1989 hakeem also borrowed a little bill
russell move where he kept his left hand low to target passes when he left his feet back in episode 2 we saw bill walton limit other all-star centers as scorers but akeem was even more
impressive against all stars at his defensive peak he held them over 5 percentage points below their normal true shooting while denting their volume numbers match by only a few of the
other defensive giants since we have plus minus data going back to 1994 we can get an idea of how valuable all this defense was using that same hybrid metric from the last episode
his impact looks great but it's short of the all-timers keep in mind though his 1993 numbers were likely even better and he seems to improve in the playoffs the box score numbers we do have for
those post-seasons view him as around a top 15 peak and that's with limited information to capture his defensive worth given how much of houston's success was driven by a strong defense
i think it's fair to assume much of olajuwon's impact was defensively driven which is hard for the box score to capture in a sense hakeem's isolation scoring and monster defense
were functionally closer to a young will chamberlain players who can carry subpar offensive talent but who might not help good offenses as much hakeem's three-point shooting offenses
did generate better results than those early will teams but i have some doubts about how he'd scale up next to another high-end talent given his passing limitations
and shot selection on the other hand he did have the tools to add off-ball value as a rebounder and pick and roll partner while providing an inside out option for any offense and his prodigious defensive timing
mobility and aggressiveness made him arguably the best defensive player of the three-point era and at his apex one of the very best big men of all time

basketball adonis david robinson generated some of the best regular season numbers in league history he and michael jordan are the only players ever to win a scoring title and defensive
player of the year but was he just a paper tiger did he crumble in the playoffs or was he actually a complex multi-faceted superstar and one of the most valuable players of
the three-point era are watching what greatness is all about where's larry bird in all this has it blocked by elijah michael jordan saves the day this series tackles one question
who was the best at his best we started the aba merger and go through the best multi-year stretches examining the legends who provided the most on-court impact these are the greatest peaks
it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that he's very special it's ghostly it's not recognizable you think of it as normal quickness but i think it transcends it goes to another level in the 80s we saw
some of the greatest offensive players to ever grace the hardwood but robinson was a callback to defensively dominate big men like bill russell in college david's quick leaping drew
comparisons to russell it took a millisecond for him to reach 11 feet with a quick hop and his long outstretched left hand listed at 7-1 robinson was a good two or three inches taller than russell
and his combination of size and jumping speed made him a devastating rim protector nasa should have conducted lab testing on how quickly robinson launched off the floor all he required
was a little knee bend to spring up off of two feet and he was almost entirely a two-footed jumper often using a quick hop to organize his feet and then swat here's another look there's the
little hop to load up and he's still on the floor when weyman tisdale nears his apex and in less than two tenths of a second robinson arrives above the rim it typically took robinson about six or
seven tenths of a second from the time he started his gather to meet the ball above the hoop for comparison this crazy michael jordan block took over eight tenths from his windup and when robinson
went directly into his bunny hop to contest he was comparable to rustle himself in time to reach 10 feet throw in robinson's length and he could just materialize out of nowhere
like a shot blocking wraith on the offensive end robinson can feel unspectacular his upper body stiffness lacks a certain sexiness for most people but that's because he was a seven foot one bionic
human whose best move was just being quicker and more explosive than normal big men despite his height he preferred to turn and face the hoop from the mid-range and
go to work out of a classic triple threat position his first step was overwhelming for most opponents and he was strong enough to power around slight contact like this
even though it's only one hard dribble he was a boatload approaching the basket with a short runway this face jab and go game was too fast for many fives of the 1990s
and it led to a parade to the free throw line robinson's free-throw rates peaked right around jordan's during their best playoff stretches despite david having the ball less than
mj and not receiving deliberate fouls like shaq and dwight howard as you can see from that list it's hard for big men to create signature shots when marching to the
free throw line constantly but as a 75 free throw shooter this was incredibly effective offense he even threw in his own mini euro step where he'd swing back the other way if he felt his first step
cut off they didn't call this pivot foot travel as much back then even though they were stricter in forcing two steps in a sense his physical gifts made robinson the 90s version of
giannis antodokupo except instead of attacking from around the three-point line robinson set up shop near the elbows and relied on a quick first step unlike giannis the
admiral blended his rim attacks with an effective face up jumper he could fake a drive with that jab step to create space then fire a clean look in the data we have access to at the end of the 90s
robinson hit 43 to 44 of his mid-range twos landing him somewhere between the 60th and 75th percentile among volume mid-range shooters this century and he could even drain those off a
dribble although he appeared less comfortable moving into his shots like this his outside shot then allowed him to sell up fakes and bee-lined to the rim and that resulted
in more lay-ups or trips back to the free-throw line back in those days he was occasionally criticized for playing like this seen merely as a jump shooter who lacked the traditional back to the
basket game to dominate like a classic big but remember back to the basket offense isn't incredibly effective unto itself kareem was basically the only big man to spearhead great offenses for the first
35 or 40 years of the shot clock and he did so next to elite guards besides robinson did have a solid low post game too his physical advantages allowed him to power into certain opponents
and once again that pressure led to quality looks at the rim or more free throws he also had a nice little fadeaway to his left shoulder and he could flow into this quickly and his size
and high release often generated a really clean look by 1995 this shot was fairly polished and he used it quite a bit against smaller defenders who gave him problems like carl malone malone's bodybuilding
strength and quick feet prevented robinson from blasting by him and he could hold deep position against david and disrupt his setups despite giving up four inches or so
agility and strength were an antidote to robinson's first step and once a drive was walled up he could target the ball with that patented slap down move and in today's jargon he would be an
admiral stopper in general biggs who were fairly strong and could move their feet well slowed robinson down by taking away the quickness advantage he held over so many traditional centers
of the 90s david could occasionally turn back to that right shoulder but this was a tougher shot for him he doesn't rotate that quickly and so squaring his shoulders to the hoop takes
an extra sometimes awkward beat against weaker defensive teams of his era robinson was less likely to encounter match-ups like this but his scoring took a major haircut
against stronger defensive teams who were more likely to have versatile big men that six percent drop in efficiency is on the large side for modern superstars and in the regular season robinson was
able to juice his scoring numbers a bit more than a typical star player by picking on weaker teams which meant that his peak regular season numbers overstated how effective his scoring arsenal was in a playoff
setting now this is still good scoring it's just not great scoring the admiral even threw in a little spin move occasionally but this was also stiffer than versions from other superstars at the time
like hakeem olajuwon even robinson's really impressive shots like this turn over olajuwon didn't leave the same mark as akim's crazy
high difficult fadeaways and this aesthetic gap helped create the impression that elijah won dominated robinson and was light years ahead of him as a player
but that narrative misses a critical part of the story and overlooks robinson's actual value on a high-level team dennis you're just a little bit too tight man you need to loosen up
over the top man be an individual so what do you want me to do well you can start by eating your pizza the wrong way crust first after a number of near wins robinson finally grabbed an mvp trophy in 1995
and led the spurs to the western finals where he ran into a buzzsaw robinson was tasked with guarding hakeem often without any help and while he defended him fairly well
on most possessions a heads-up battle with akeem was a bad match up for the admiral olajuwon had some monster games in their regular season meetings and akeem's quickness could take away
robinson's first step well on the other end robinson couldn't really take away his dream shaking and wild shot making robinson was a really good man defender he used his length to contest shots well
and he was able to hold his own against the powerful brutes of that era grappling with a young shaquille o'neal here before his quickness wins out for the steal even though he wasn't great moving
laterally he was long and springy enough to recover but he was susceptible to up fakes and at times he could be a little too quick off his feet which showed in a number of different
defensive scenarios especially near the hoop jumping like this fed into hakeem's hands as a ball faking houdini throwing his dream shakes into robinson and setting him up for
memorable scoring highlights combine elijahuan's tough shot making and his own natural quickness and it makes for a lopsided game of one-on-one but that's the thing about robinson he's a good one-on-one player
but he's a 5 on 5 star his off ball game was just as if not more important than his isolation scoring his face up jumper made him a viable catch and shoot finisher in the
mid-range but more importantly it made him a pick and pop weapon this wasn't the spread pick and roll that is so popular today but the spurs ran plenty of ball screens
inside the three-point arc where robinson could pop to open space and knock down positive value shots by 1994 this shot was pretty dialed in for david and he could even turn it into an up
fake and go in these situations his athletic gifts also made him a natural finisher around the basket this play against the rockets shows just how easy he could make it look catching the ball 10 feet away and
casually gliding by a fleet of defenders without a dribble his athleticism made him a weapon in transition as well where he used his straight line speed to outrun slower
burlier centers of his time it's less common today but this penalized bigger lineups who crash the glass and it was normal for robinson to outsprint opponents
multiple times in a game like he did to shaquille o'neal in this 1996 matchup david was one of the better lob threats of that era a giant explosive target and that's
two-time defensive player of the year alonzo mourning he just rag dolls i do think he was a touch more fluid flowing into these in his first few
seasons but lobs were certainly part of his offensive package in those peak years san antonio started to unlock this talent in 1996 when they ran more side pick and rolls with avery johnson
who grew comfortable with these reeds and i think between his mid-range shooting and his finishing skills robinson would have made a wonderful partner for a high-level pick-and-roll guard
instead he was asked to carry the entire offense in the mid-90s which wasn't quite an ideal role the admiral was best suited to anchor a team's defense and play a hybrid role on offense acting
as a co-pilot or second best offensive player the exact role he would play after his peak when tim duncan arrived in 1998 duncan shouldered a larger isolation
load while the flexible robinson played largely the same style out of the high post robinson's off ball skills allowed him to fit in well with another talent where he could still co-anchor some of
the offense here drawing a double for a huge three in the title clinching game in 1999 and he could mix in his own isolation scoring in more select doses the result was
a decrease in volume for robinson with an increase in scoring efficiency a slightly above average offense for the spurs as a team and more importantly a dominant defense behind those twin towers
the spurs engineered arguably the greatest defensive stretch in league history holding their playoff opponents about 7 points per 100 below their regular season efficiency a
feat match by only a few teams and those teams had weaker regular season defenses while duncan was a great defender out of the gate it was robinson's impact that led the
spurs on defense and while many view duncan as the clear alpha dog on those teams after 1998 robinson wasn't far behind because of his two-way impact and ability to blend with duncan
on offense robinson was a good entry passer in the mid 90s and his best passes were from the perimeter where he could face up and survey the floor in this position
his height allowed him to see the action unfold and he could fire two cutters with decent speed or he could feather in deliveries with a bit more touch he was always a
willing extra passer in this 1993 play he can see the court and quickly flips it to a high leverage spot and by 1995 i thought he was better at processing cutting action in front of him this is a really nice
read here quickly spotting that his cutter's defender goes behind another laker in a kind of half-hearted tag and while there's no quick shot it's the kind of pass that
demonstrates some understanding of what defenses are doing and it shows some anticipation although he wasn't elite in these spots he misses the potential draymond green special here
and in my film study i'm not sure he ball faked in a situation like this one time to manipulate the defense here's another one from the same game where he doesn't have time to really process the backside action
and misses a potential layup when he couldn't survey the floor the results were choppier he can't quickly process that the corner is open here and with his head down he desperately
flails this to an outlet with his back to the basket as long as he could see that help coming from the top his kickout passes were pretty solid and this created plenty of open shots for
the spurs when they spaced the floor around him here he turns to spot the help and in trying to locate his teammate the delivery gets away from him a bit
here's another one where he can't see the double coming and his instinct is to turn and pass but again it's not the smoothest delivery and it's deflected in front of his body
his lack of a handle and that lateral stiffness hurt him in these spots where well-timed double teams could prevent him from quickly moving it and in this case he's clamped up and
misses another possible dagger still i think that high post extra passing prowess along with his massive defensive impact was the key to unlocking robinson's value as a defensive superstar
and offensive number two from 1998 to 2000 robinson logged 37 minutes per game in the playoffs well duncan played 41 minutes a game when robinson sat on the bench during
those years the spurs were outscored by 16 points every 48 minutes but when robinson played they were a whopping plus 11 and since we've been tracking this data
since 1997 that is the largest change among any rotation player on record in the postseason in the 98-99 playoffs the spurs were actually better in the limited minutes duncan was on the bench
we're only talking about a few hundred minutes here so there's plenty of noise but this is a huge reminder of how impactful a hybrid player like robinson can be without being the team's clear-cut
number one scorer this makes sense when we remember these were dominant defensive teams that were slightly above average on offense it also brings us full circle
back to bill russell who as we examined in the series prelude dominated the 60s without being his team's best offensive player i wonder what robinson's career would have looked like with another offensive
star next to him and furthermore how would we view him if he was the one who joined a 32 year old duncan in 1998 and propelled the spurs over the top launching the popovich
era robinson was clearly a better offensive player than russell although despite that incredible speed off the floor and his considerable defensive impact he wasn't entirely on russ's level at
that end his reactions to threats were quite quick especially if he could see the threat in front of him but robinson could be a bit too stationary in sub-par
positions he wasn't really down in his stance pivoting around a lot like bill walton but i think he didn't bounce around a lot because of his limitations moving laterally
his lateral movement wasn't really poor but it was more laborious and stiffer especially compared to his straight ahead quickness and so he couldn't easily slide horizontally in the paint
which limited him compared to some of his normal straight line movement in help situations just like we saw in his passing game he wasn't great at mapping the court that he couldn't see
and sometimes that allowed breakdowns behind his field of vision pick and roll also wasn't a huge part of the game then but robinson's horizontal movement meant this wasn't really a defensive strength
for him and in general he tried to avoid stretching to the perimeter still a strong offensive game and nearly goat defense yields some massive overall impact
we have regular season plus minus data going back to 1994 and on a per game basis robinson looks like one of the best regular season players we've ever seen using our historical box score
estimates his playoff value during these peak seasons looks good but not quite what we'd expect for a top 10 candidate however the admiral moves up a rank when
we use his numbers from 1998 and we know when we add in plus minus data for those years he looked like a titan this reinforces what the box score can't capture
robinson's combination of quality isolation scoring and off-ball offense along with that massive defensive impact make him one of the most valuable players of his era
his two-way skill set scales well on a variety of championship rosters and as a result there aren't five centers since the aba merger who i think have peaked higher
than david robinson

[00:00] there was a time when kevin garnett was
[00:02] regarded by many as the sport's best
[00:04] player he nearly claimed back-to-back
[00:07] mvps
[00:08] before team failures derailed his
[00:10] stature
[00:11] critics called him a weak offensive
[00:13] player who couldn't lead a team to a
[00:16] championship
[00:17] but was that true what if his
[00:20] team's weaknesses actually drowned out
[00:22] his strengths
[00:24] what if kg's championship value came
[00:26] from everything besides
[00:28] scoring and what if kevin garnett
[00:31] was actually a blend of offense and
[00:33] defense
[00:34] that made him one of the best two-way
[00:36] players
[00:39] [Applause]
[00:42] ever
[00:47] [Applause]
[00:50] this series tackles one question who was
[00:53] the best
[00:54] at his best we started the aba merger
[00:57] and go through the best
[00:58] multi-year stretches examining the
[01:00] legends who provided the most
[01:01] on-court impact these are the greatest
[01:10] peaks
[01:12] kevin you you're doing as well as you
[01:14] did last year personally but
[01:16] i tend to get the same golf this ain't
[01:19] golf
[01:20] st tennis it ain't about me
[01:25] throughout this series the defensive
[01:26] grates that we've looked at have all
[01:28] been
[01:28] big active shot blockers who patrolled
[01:31] the paint
[01:32] but garnett was an evolutionary leap
[01:34] forward
[01:35] at nearly seven feet without shoes he
[01:38] had the height of a traditional
[01:40] intimidating center yet moved like a
[01:42] perimeter player
[01:44] this unique combination of length and
[01:46] mobility allowed him to cover
[01:48] large swaths of the court in only a few
[01:51] steps
[01:52] which turned him into a basketball
[01:53] octopus on defense
[01:56] here he starts toward kobe bryant from
[01:58] about 30 feet away from the hoop
[02:00] slides his feet twice and just vaporizes
[02:03] his drive from behind
[02:06] these long tentacles could erase shots
[02:08] from the top of the circle like this
[02:10] but it was garnett's incredible mobility
[02:12] and awareness that separated him as a
[02:14] defender
[02:16] his large hops quickly took him from the
[02:18] perimeter to the rim
[02:20] and positioned him to jump on a whim and
[02:23] agility like this for someone his size
[02:25] is unheard of
[02:26] he's running backwards here swivels
[02:29] inside toward the ball
[02:30] then back to the other side in one
[02:32] motion and defends the dunk in
[02:34] transition with those huge strides
[02:37] he could slide in front of quicker
[02:39] players on the perimeter and stay with
[02:41] them
[02:41] against the lightning quick allen
[02:42] iverson here he makes it look easy
[02:45] and garnett could move well in every
[02:47] direction
[02:48] recovering backwards here before a
[02:50] doctor octavius arm
[02:52] breaks up the pass and even with those
[02:54] physical gifts
[02:55] i think his best defensive attribute was
[02:57] his mind
[02:59] this is nanosecond processing to let his
[03:01] teammate contest
[03:03] and the awareness to follow the
[03:04] shooter's eyes makes the steel
[03:06] possible kg tracked the ball better than
[03:10] maybe any player in nba history he was a
[03:14] hardwood
[03:15] sentinel materializing in the paint the
[03:17] instant he detected a threat
[03:20] he's chasing a wing here but lingers
[03:22] when he senses danger in the pick and
[03:24] roll
[03:25] then when it's kicked out he knows this
[03:27] teammate can rotate to the shooter
[03:29] but his radar detects an up fake so he
[03:31] stays and just destroys what would be a
[03:33] layup
[03:35] it takes a second look to realize the
[03:37] brilliance of some of these decisions
[03:39] this place seems pretty vanilla but
[03:41] minnesota is actually in a zone
[03:43] michael ola candy should slide here with
[03:46] garnett staying in the middle
[03:48] but garnett recognizes that would leave
[03:50] him on an island against
[03:51] kobe so kg audibles to slide up and
[03:54] protect the whole weak side himself
[03:56] and because wings can't blow by him it
[03:59] turns into a long
[04:00] three watch the ball on any garnet play
[04:04] and he feels like a normal rim protector
[04:07] but watch more closely and the plays
[04:09] become remarkable
[04:10] he cheats over to the strong side early
[04:12] to take the roll man if needed
[04:14] then still pounces on the dribbler at
[04:16] the rim
[04:18] these plays were the norm for him
[04:20] stalking the ball like a middle
[04:21] linebacker
[04:22] and shrinking the dimensions of the
[04:24] court
[04:26] this reaction could make a precog
[04:28] jealous the second carmelo anthony has
[04:30] space here
[04:31] garnett moves and his pogo sticking puts
[04:34] him in position to spring up
[04:36] at any moment what a sequence
[04:39] he reacted so fast at times it looked
[04:42] choreographed
[04:43] he's moving in sync with the crossover
[04:46] from the other side of the court
[04:47] then teleports to the front of the rim
[04:49] and it takes a circus shot to beat that
[04:52] defense
[04:53] kg was just everywhere all the time
[04:57] and he never stopped moving i mean
[05:00] he still really hasn't stopped moving i
[05:02] think the man might hop around in his
[05:04] sleep like a shark
[05:05] and this perpetual motion let him bounce
[05:09] from one
[05:10] threat to the next over and over
[05:13] and his combination of length agility
[05:16] and perhaps
[05:17] the highest revving motor in nba history
[05:20] meant kg was never out of any play my my
[05:24] word and on top of all of that
[05:27] he knew every trick in the book he sends
[05:30] his teammate to double the post
[05:31] zoning up these two big men and he knows
[05:35] in this set his man is looking for the
[05:37] entry pass instead of shooting
[05:38] and he can break it up from the free
[05:40] throw line
[05:42] his positioning was often perfect and
[05:44] tactical
[05:45] here's sitting in a driving lane and as
[05:47] the ball approaches he slides to play
[05:49] the pass
[05:50] but keeps himself within arm's length
[05:52] and garnett's hands are too good to
[05:54] escape that gambit
[05:56] he had that bill russell move from
[05:58] episode 8 tracking potential passes with
[06:01] his offhand
[06:02] as he contested shots and garnett played
[06:05] drop-off passes like this
[06:06] incredibly well not always going after a
[06:09] block or contesting in the air
[06:11] and frequently jabbing toward a
[06:13] penetrator and then peeling off it if he
[06:16] felt a pass coming instead
[06:19] here it is against a teenage lebron
[06:21] james garnett
[06:22] reads his eyes and court position to
[06:24] quickly play the passing lane
[06:26] and then still recovers back to contest
[06:28] he hopped on the up fake there
[06:31] and that was a minor crack in kg's armor
[06:34] but there weren't too many other weak
[06:36] spots he was vulnerable to power
[06:38] only against the strongest of the brutes
[06:41] which meant shaq
[06:42] and maybe a few other really strong big
[06:44] men at the time
[06:46] but i think playing at around 240 pounds
[06:48] in those years
[06:49] with his high center of gravity made his
[06:52] incredible help defense
[06:54] slightly less effective in traffic where
[06:56] he couldn't lodge himself firmly under
[06:58] the rim to disrupt these kinds of plays
[07:02] but it's hard to find him making
[07:04] defensive mistakes
[07:05] on this one he actually relaxes when the
[07:08] shot goes up
[07:09] he usually plugs the passing lane here
[07:11] instead of ball watching
[07:12] and here he's chasing a wing around and
[07:14] that prevents him from turning around
[07:16] and covering up this breakdown
[07:20] in situations where he needed to rotate
[07:22] into space
[07:23] garnett was an excellent rim protector
[07:25] and he's perhaps the most schematically
[07:27] sound defender i've
[07:28] ever studied almost never flubbing
[07:31] assignments
[07:33] avery johnson actually once complained
[07:35] that he would call out your plays
[07:38] on the court because he scouted
[07:40] opponents so well
[07:42] this scouting helped him play passing
[07:44] lanes where
[07:45] those cephalopod arms suction cupped a
[07:48] number of balls
[07:49] and made even basic passes difficult
[07:52] kg averaged nearly two steals per 100
[07:55] during those years
[07:56] elite for a big man and with him on the
[07:58] court in 03 and 04
[08:00] the timberwolves defense was the
[08:01] equivalent of a top 10 d
[08:04] but without him they played like a
[08:06] bottom five defense because
[08:08] his defensive teammates range from
[08:10] mediocre to
[08:11] porous during those seasons pipm
[08:15] which uses this kind of plus minus data
[08:17] along with the box score
[08:19] views these years as a top 15 defensive
[08:22] peak
[08:22] since 1997 and using only plus minus
[08:26] data and adjusting for
[08:27] teammate and opponent quality these are
[08:29] seen as two
[08:31] of the very best defensive seasons on
[08:33] record
[08:34] kg was also an excellent man defender
[08:37] against
[08:38] nearly anyone his length made shooting
[08:41] uncomfortable
[08:42] and he was one of the few players in
[08:43] league history who could truly guard
[08:45] five positions wings who attacked him
[08:48] were met with heavy resistance
[08:50] and a number of dangerous perimeter
[08:52] players wouldn't even go at him on
[08:54] switches
[08:55] those who did attack him even in the
[08:58] open court
[08:59] could meet the long arm of the law and
[09:02] his capacity to change directions with
[09:04] those
[09:04] tap dancing feet made the impossible
[09:07] look easy
[09:08] this is a 60-0 stop and swivel back to
[09:12] block kobe
[09:13] at the top of the square that doesn't
[09:16] make sense
[09:17] shaq was probably the only true mismatch
[09:19] for him in the entire league
[09:21] but even against big centers he still
[09:23] held his own
[09:24] here he doesn't bite on a fake from the
[09:27] 280 pound vitaly patopico
[09:29] although again occasionally up fakes
[09:32] could be a problem
[09:33] chris weber gets him with the second
[09:34] move here but
[09:36] weber desperately needed upfakes against
[09:38] garnett because he posted a
[09:40] 44 true shooting mark against him
[09:43] in these seasons kevin also really
[09:47] bothered tim
[09:47] duncan holding him under 50 true
[09:50] shooting
[09:51] when they were on the court together
[09:53] from 2002 to 2004
[09:55] that's about seven percent lower than
[09:58] duncan's normal efficiency
[09:59] and amazingly when both kg and duncan
[10:01] were on the court for those 12 games
[10:03] their team scored the exact same number
[10:06] of points
[10:08] unfortunately since garnett was emerging
[10:11] from an
[10:11] era of golden centers blocking under two
[10:14] shots per game
[10:15] wasn't quite enough to win over
[10:17] defensive player of the year voters
[10:19] who were looking for 3 or 4 blocks from
[10:22] a 7-footer
[10:24] but his defense was rarely under fire
[10:27] after each playoff elimination during
[10:29] these seasons
[10:30] instead the questions were about
[10:32] garnett's offense
[10:34] and specifically his ability to score
[10:40] magic is listening right now and magic
[10:42] kevin garnett does not have the
[10:44] supporting cast if he had james worthy
[10:46] kareem abdul-jabbar
[10:47] or kevin mchale robert parish he would
[10:49] be winning championships right now
[10:51] by far the biggest criticism of garnett
[10:54] was his inability to take over games
[10:56] with his scoring in key moments
[10:59] where tim duncan was celebrated as a
[11:01] classic low post weapon
[11:03] garnett was lamented as just a jump
[11:06] shooter
[11:07] the same stigma attached to david
[11:08] robinson back in episode 7.
[11:11] ironically garnett was actually one of
[11:13] the best
[11:14] outside shooting big men of his era he
[11:16] made nearly 43
[11:18] of his long twos in 2003 and 4 which was
[11:21] the 7th best mark in the entire league
[11:24] this was better than dirk nowitzki in
[11:26] those seasons
[11:27] and much like what we saw last episode
[11:29] from kobe bryant
[11:30] kg could pull these from deep off a jab
[11:33] step
[11:34] and since he had an incredible handle
[11:36] for a player his size
[11:38] he could probe into these shots like he
[11:41] was a guard
[11:42] kg's ball handling was so secure that
[11:44] minnesota had him bring it up at times
[11:46] when they ran
[11:47] out of point guards and sometimes he
[11:49] just worked that right into a pull-up
[11:51] jumper
[11:52] of course there's still that trade-off
[11:54] we've discussed on these long outside
[11:56] shots even though garnett was four
[11:58] percentage points ahead of league
[11:59] average
[12:00] on his long twos they weren't that
[12:03] efficient as a half court shot
[12:05] at least early in the shot clock and
[12:07] that can limit a player's
[12:08] overall efficiency unlike robinson
[12:12] garnett didn't have a first step that
[12:14] just marched him to the free-throw line
[12:16] constantly
[12:17] his initial move wasn't quite as quick
[12:20] and more importantly he lacked the
[12:22] strength and power
[12:24] to drive through minor contact
[12:27] hand checking like this derailed his
[12:28] penetration and old friend carl malone
[12:31] bothered him this way
[12:32] in the 2004 western finals pushing him
[12:35] off his spots
[12:36] and rerouting him with little nudges and
[12:38] arm bars
[12:40] it's subtle but you can see it here a
[12:42] little push sends garnett toward the
[12:44] baseline
[12:45] instead of being able to explode up on
[12:47] the strong side of the cup
[12:48] then he thinks better of challenging
[12:50] shaq
[12:52] the brick wall that was o'neill deterred
[12:54] kg's forays to the basket
[12:56] in their playoff matchups primarily
[12:59] because kevin couldn't rise up and
[13:01] finish through contact well instead he
[13:03] avoided contact in many of these aerial
[13:05] situations
[13:06] which suppressed his free throw numbers
[13:09] unlike sturdier big men with broader
[13:11] shoulders
[13:12] garnett couldn't power through shot
[13:14] blockers like this
[13:15] and because he didn't have the balance
[13:17] to drop step and claim that space
[13:19] on the near block he often adjusted into
[13:22] trickier
[13:23] shots although he never gave up on a
[13:25] play
[13:26] some of this was from his high center of
[13:28] gravity it only took
[13:30] minor contact to throw him off balance
[13:32] when he was upright
[13:33] but this was more of a limitation than
[13:35] an achilles heel
[13:37] he was still able to lean into some
[13:39] contact at the rim
[13:41] and garnett's free throw rates during
[13:42] these seasons were around
[13:44] average among typical 20-point scorers
[13:48] he didn't always shy away from contact
[13:50] either sometimes backing down
[13:52] softer players until he was fouled or
[13:54] found a closer look
[13:56] when he could turn the corner on his
[13:58] drives that downhill pressure
[14:00] also drew fouls and he was more
[14:02] comfortable jumping off of one leg
[14:05] into open space on these flowing attacks
[14:09] in instances where he was cut off that
[14:12] handle helped him probe closer and
[14:14] closer to the rim
[14:15] and he often went to this spin back move
[14:17] when he was walled off on his
[14:18] penetration
[14:20] have i mentioned he's a seven footer kg
[14:23] added another layer to his dribble
[14:24] drives with his passing
[14:27] which is functionally how perimeter
[14:29] players spearhead great offense
[14:31] collapsing defenses and then dishing to
[14:33] open teammates
[14:35] and in this sense garnett's desire to
[14:38] play like
[14:38] a 6'12 michael jordan traded in hook
[14:42] shots for perimeter playmaking
[14:44] and some of these passes were really
[14:46] nice finding layups at the end of drives
[14:48] like a great guard would
[14:51] he even had the capacity to manipulate
[14:53] defenders occasionally
[14:55] using the look away here on the drop-off
[14:58] only there was rarely a great finisher
[15:00] on the end of these connections
[15:02] he also dimed up cutters from the top
[15:04] his size and instinct to quickly move
[15:07] the ball
[15:07] helped him find most of these openings
[15:10] man it was hard to score on those
[15:12] pistons and on this one he's reading the
[15:15] primary screening action to his left
[15:17] so he's a touch late firing this inside
[15:19] to his teammate
[15:22] he was arguably better as a passer out
[15:25] of the post
[15:26] he'd pick teams apart if they fell
[15:28] asleep and he could find some gems on
[15:31] tight cuts like this
[15:32] too with all of that said i think his
[15:35] most impressive passes were on the
[15:37] interior
[15:38] where he could wheel into scoring
[15:40] position and punish defenses in narrow
[15:42] quarters after they helped onto him
[15:45] some of these were just ridiculously
[15:47] good he's anticipating a double because
[15:50] he's matched up with a guard
[15:51] and he even busted out some misdirection
[15:53] from the post too
[15:55] patiently looking to the perimeter here
[15:57] before shipping a nikola jokic special
[16:00] boom just like that it's perfect of
[16:02] course garnett could also
[16:04] score out of the post too he didn't live
[16:07] on the low block like traditional big
[16:09] men
[16:09] but he was effective down there
[16:11] especially on deep
[16:13] catches he threw in an up and under move
[16:15] every once in a while
[16:17] goodbye although despite some tutelage
[16:20] from kevin mchale
[16:21] i think he could have used pump fakes
[16:23] more down there to keep defenders honest
[16:26] and draw fouls instead kg
[16:30] lived off a steady diet of fadeaways
[16:32] over either shoulder
[16:33] and again it's easy to see jordan's
[16:36] influence on garnett's offensive
[16:38] approach
[16:38] on some of these back to the basket
[16:40] moves
[16:42] the incredible height of kg's release
[16:44] made this shot
[16:45] nearly unblockable and he could flow
[16:48] right into the fade
[16:49] or set it up with a quick spin in one
[16:51] direction before
[16:53] falling back in another the earliest
[16:56] synergy data from 2005 and 6
[16:58] pegs him as the third most efficient
[17:00] post player in the league
[17:02] and first among volume scoring big men
[17:06] so while he didn't live on the interior
[17:08] or at the free throw line like other big
[17:10] men
[17:11] there was enough in garnet's bag to make
[17:13] him a
[17:14] good but not great scorer because of
[17:17] some of his limitations
[17:18] his playoff scoring numbers lag behind
[17:21] most players in this series
[17:23] although his regular season numbers are
[17:26] strong enough
[17:26] that he might have been more efficient
[17:28] with a larger playoff sample
[17:31] or with better teammates garnett
[17:34] never played with a grade a shot creator
[17:37] or passer during these seasons
[17:38] instead suiting up next to scoring
[17:41] oriented point guards like sam cassell
[17:44] these guards could play the pick and pop
[17:46] game with kg who scored
[17:48] tons of points by floating to the
[17:50] perimeter after a screen
[17:52] and comfortably draining long jumpers
[17:55] but he was missing teammates who could
[17:57] take advantage of his movement with high
[17:59] quality passing
[18:00] let alone spoon feed him easy baskets
[18:03] this is an easy roll pass or even a lob
[18:06] for layup
[18:06] but it never arrives and they couldn't
[18:10] unlock his size and athleticism
[18:12] rolling downhill that much despite his
[18:14] ability to get
[18:15] way up on lob passes
[18:18] many of garnett's easy bunnies were in
[18:21] transition
[18:22] because he sprinted so hard on every
[18:25] play
[18:25] scientists might want to check if he was
[18:27] powered by cold fusion
[18:29] because like clockwork he took off on
[18:32] every breakout
[18:33] and could beat other big men down the
[18:35] court and even though he never played
[18:36] with a
[18:37] road runner point guard kg flashed his
[18:40] downhill finishing ability
[18:42] on these fast breaks despite his
[18:45] intensity
[18:46] he played 40 minutes a game in the
[18:48] regular season and
[18:49] 44 minutes a night in the playoffs
[18:52] because minnesota lacked
[18:54] depth and he did make some
[18:56] uncharacteristic plays
[18:58] late in games from what seemed to be
[19:00] fatigue
[19:03] another issue with those teams was a
[19:04] lack of three-point shooting
[19:06] they took a ton of long twos and
[19:09] surrounded garnett with sub-par
[19:10] three-point shooters
[19:12] which meant they couldn't penalize teams
[19:14] for doubling in the post
[19:15] or take advantage of his kickout passes
[19:18] the timberwolves finished 27th in the
[19:20] league in three point attempts in these
[19:22] seasons
[19:22] taking half as many as hakeem's rockets
[19:25] did a decade
[19:26] earlier which feels criminal given
[19:28] garnett's timing and
[19:29] feel for kickout passes and the success
[19:32] we've seen three-point shooters have
[19:33] surrounding other big men who weren't on
[19:36] garnett's level as a passer
[19:39] this might be one of the reasons the
[19:41] timberwolves offense fell flat
[19:42] in the playoffs moving from the 89th
[19:45] percentile in the regular season
[19:47] to the 30th percentile in the postseason
[19:50] although i think injuries were likely a
[19:53] larger factor
[19:54] minnesota played without a viable backup
[19:56] point guard on the floor
[19:58] one third of the time and the wolves
[20:00] offense dropped by
[20:02] nine points in those minutes even with
[20:05] just half of that drop off their playoff
[20:07] efficiency would look
[20:08] much closer to their strong regular
[20:10] season offense
[20:13] like robinson before him so much of the
[20:16] big ticket's value was his ability to
[20:18] play off
[20:18] another high-end offensive talent while
[20:21] simultaneously leading the defense
[20:24] the precise role he would play after
[20:26] moving on to greener pastures
[20:39] greetings cap the legend greetings
[20:42] kingdom no my name
[20:46] it's pretty clear that garnett couldn't
[20:48] ramp up his scoring volume
[20:49] another 15 or 20 percent to the levels
[20:52] we've seen in the last three episodes
[20:54] but his scoring numbers certainly would
[20:56] have been boosted with teammates who
[20:58] could have created easy shots for him
[21:00] or optimized his activity without the
[21:02] ball
[21:03] that off-ball game was a big part of his
[21:06] offensive package
[21:07] where he could catch and go right into
[21:09] his moves and whether he was attacking a
[21:12] closeout
[21:12] after picking and popping or just moving
[21:15] into a catch-and-shoot jumper like a
[21:17] super-sized guard
[21:19] garnet could score quickly you may have
[21:21] noticed that he often
[21:23] passed quickly too there's another long
[21:26] two
[21:26] and split second decision making like
[21:28] this such as short roll
[21:30] passing helps maintain advantages and a
[21:33] quick hitting game
[21:34] doesn't take away opportunities from
[21:36] teammates
[21:38] here he gives it up and instantly cuts
[21:40] into a scoring chance against the clock
[21:42] and he misses a pass but wheels right
[21:44] into a big bucket
[21:46] kg hit most of these short roll
[21:49] connective tissue kind of passes
[21:51] and we saw this with larry bird where
[21:53] dynamic sometimes
[21:54] touch passes create a kind of
[21:56] frictionless low
[21:58] viscosity offense where speedy actions
[22:01] kind of grease the rails for teammates
[22:04] these skills add value next to better
[22:06] and better players
[22:08] which is exactly why four years later
[22:10] boston took the league
[22:12] by storm behind an older less agile
[22:14] garnet
[22:16] his extra passing fit next to paul
[22:19] pierce and ray allen
[22:20] as did his off-ball scoring game in
[22:22] those catch and shoot situations
[22:25] add in garnett's non-stop activity and
[22:28] ability to fill in
[22:29] any role or area on the floor and boston
[22:32] produced a good regular season
[22:34] and post-season offense but it was their
[22:37] defense that carried them to a
[22:39] championship
[22:40] garnett lifted boston to historical
[22:42] heights on that end
[22:44] and was the linchpin of a unit that
[22:46] locked down a scorching lakers offense
[22:49] authoring one of the most impressive nba
[22:51] finals i've seen from a defender
[22:54] he couldn't leap quite as high or slide
[22:56] quite as well
[22:57] but he stalked kobe bryant on a number
[23:00] of plays like this
[23:01] and won a high level game of basketball
[23:04] chess
[23:04] anticipating specific passes and
[23:07] plugging any gaps in the back line
[23:09] he goes to help on this drive and then
[23:11] instantly somehow
[23:13] processes james posey helping off of
[23:15] bryant so he rotates
[23:17] back and then smothers bryant at the
[23:19] hoop
[23:21] a key part of boston's defensive success
[23:24] was garnett's ability to defend the pick
[23:26] and roll
[23:27] and he was even better at this art
[23:29] during his peak
[23:30] all of his s-class abilities intersected
[23:33] in pick and roll defense
[23:35] sliding in front of smaller players
[23:37] blanketing the entire court
[23:39] and recovering to the ball if needed and
[23:42] he was absolutely incredible at
[23:44] containing dribblers in this coverage
[23:46] somehow preventing a split here from
[23:48] chauncey billups
[23:49] and at times it looked like he was a
[23:51] mirror of the ball handler
[23:53] sliding with him but almost always
[23:55] recovering back into the play
[23:58] and if he needed to stay with a guard
[24:01] that was no problem either
[24:02] again the hand tracks the basketball for
[24:05] the steal
[24:07] thanks to his positioning and size
[24:09] garnett was also an excellent defensive
[24:11] rebounder
[24:12] and he did a ton of little things like
[24:14] this so well
[24:15] for instance he was the first player i
[24:17] saw use this screen move
[24:18] to seal off a shot blocker for a driving
[24:22] guard
[24:22] this play is from the year 2000
[24:25] [Music]
[24:26] add it all up and garnett might
[24:28] contribute positive value in more areas
[24:31] than any
[24:32] player ever which is why he boasted some
[24:35] of the
[24:35] very best plus minus numbers ever
[24:38] recorded from the regular season
[24:40] these scoreboard-based stats tend to
[24:42] view kg as a strong all-star on
[24:45] offense too although playoff metrics
[24:47] that rely on the box score are
[24:49] lower on him primarily because of his
[24:51] scoring numbers
[24:53] but remember those box score numbers
[24:55] don't capture his smothering horizontal
[24:57] value
[24:58] on defense and they are based on a small
[25:01] sample
[25:02] against only a few opponents if we
[25:05] accounted for the huge minutes that he
[25:07] played
[25:07] he'd look more like a top 20 peak or so
[25:10] in box plus minus and pipm
[25:13] but i still think that undersells his
[25:15] impact
[25:17] despite his warts as a scorer garnett's
[25:19] quick
[25:20] passing offensive versatility spacing
[25:22] and defense
[25:23] make him one of the most scalable
[25:25] players in league history
[25:27] perfect for super charging any remotely
[25:29] contending team
[25:30] as an offensive number two and defensive
[25:33] superstar
[25:35] and that combination of all-star level
[25:37] talent on offense
[25:39] and historically great defense gave
[25:42] kevin garnett
[25:43] one of the nba's greatest peaks

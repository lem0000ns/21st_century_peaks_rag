[00:00] in the last two episodes we've seen
[00:02] two-way big men
[00:03] dominate in the golden era of centers
[00:06] but the last goliath of that era was the
[00:09] biggest
[00:10] shaquille o'neal o'neill was quite
[00:13] simply
[00:14] the most physically overpowering athlete
[00:16] in the history of basketball
[00:18] or maybe any sport he was more nimble
[00:21] than players he outweighed by
[00:23] 100 pounds and in his apex
[00:26] there was far more to his game than just
[00:29] bullying people
[00:30] under the rim but what were those other
[00:33] pieces
[00:34] and were they enough to make him the
[00:37] best offensive big man
[00:41] [Applause]
[00:42] greatness ever all about where's larry
[00:45] bird in all this
[00:47] has it blocked by elijah michael jordan
[00:50] saves the day this series tackles one
[00:54] question who was the best at his best
[00:57] we start at the aba merger and go
[00:59] through the best multi-year stretches
[01:01] examining the legends who provided the
[01:03] most on-court impact
[01:05] these are the greatest peaks
[01:23] now i've never seen that
[01:28] when he entered the league in 1993 shaq
[01:31] was already a
[01:32] 300 plus pound physical marvel before
[01:35] o'neill wilt
[01:36] chamberlain was the benchmark for power
[01:38] on the court but shaq took things to a
[01:41] whole new level after his rookie season
[01:44] they actually needed to
[01:45] shack proof the baskets and by his peak
[01:48] years in los
[01:49] angeles he tipped the scales at around
[01:52] 340 pounds
[01:55] his power game actually started without
[01:58] the ball
[01:59] we rarely think of off ball movement
[02:01] like this but o'neil created advantages
[02:03] by
[02:03] working for an extra three or four feet
[02:06] that made all the difference
[02:08] with the ball in the wing shack flashes
[02:11] to the post but is doubled
[02:12] so moving it to the top creates an
[02:14] easier entry and notice o'neill
[02:16] sit down and drive backwards at an angle
[02:19] to get deeper
[02:22] same position here only reggie miller
[02:24] sags to prevent a pass to shaq
[02:26] but o'neill sneaks a step or two closer
[02:29] to the goal
[02:30] and so when it's swung to the corner
[02:31] shaq again seals himself deeper to set
[02:34] up a dunk
[02:36] this was decidedly different than wilt
[02:39] who
[02:39] often parked himself in a spot and
[02:42] waited in a fairly upright position for
[02:44] an entry
[02:45] right here he could seal bill russell
[02:48] under the rim
[02:49] but in general he wasn't looking for
[02:51] positional advantages like this
[02:53] and while some of this is specific to an
[02:56] arrow with less bully ball in general
[02:58] it's also a difference in philosophy
[03:01] when shaquille moved across the lane he
[03:03] was trying to get closer to the rim
[03:06] wilt would move more toward the ball he
[03:09] doesn't duck in front of his man but
[03:11] instead flashes to a spot like a finesse
[03:13] player
[03:15] take ball reversals for example this is
[03:18] ok position but changing sides allows
[03:21] shaq to get a quarter step
[03:22] and then chisel out a much deeper catch
[03:26] and that's unstoppable to prevent
[03:29] o'neill from getting that step
[03:30] savior defenders took away his cut but
[03:34] then reversing sides
[03:35] opened a new door because he was such a
[03:37] massive target
[03:39] these counters are similar to perimeter
[03:41] players cutting back door
[03:43] off and overplay only shaq's counters
[03:45] were about grappling for position in the
[03:47] paint
[03:48] and he's sprightly enough to make
[03:50] catches like this
[03:52] if teams tried to overplay the baseline
[03:54] he could spin out the other side for the
[03:56] lob
[03:58] remember his defender is worried about
[04:00] shaq getting
[04:01] inside that low leg to the baseline
[04:04] where it's game over
[04:05] if he seals him off yet o'neill's quick
[04:09] enough to
[04:09] punish that overplay in an instant with
[04:11] those light tap-dancing feet
[04:14] this is some basketball jujitsu feeling
[04:17] more weight on his right leg
[04:18] and then rolling off to go time up the
[04:21] lob
[04:23] this explosive lateral athleticism is
[04:26] often overlooked in shack
[04:28] moving quickly at oblique angles
[04:31] was the basis of his power game he would
[04:34] drive through his victims from the hips
[04:36] to overpower them with angles wilt
[04:39] didn't have that
[04:40] same low base explosiveness to spin or
[04:44] pirouette quite like o'neill his
[04:46] footwork was stiffer and he lacked the
[04:48] handle to set up these moves
[04:50] whereas shaq's agility combined with his
[04:53] weight carved out
[04:54] so many of his easy buckets shaq
[04:57] unleashed violence from the floor with
[05:00] his
[05:01] trunk and massive lower body wilt has
[05:04] said he was sensitive to being seen as a
[05:06] mere brute at the time
[05:08] but shaq leaned into this power as a way
[05:10] to displace opponents before he even
[05:12] jumped
[05:13] chamberlain was strong enough to have
[05:15] this effect too
[05:16] moving players with his lower body but
[05:19] it wasn't the norm for him like it was
[05:21] shaq who bullied players onto their
[05:24] heels like a basketball
[05:25] yokozuna turning 260 pound tim duncan
[05:29] into a pinata to set up this drop step
[05:33] o'neill had some finesse too he's
[05:35] setting up the drop step but dikembe
[05:37] mutombos stays square with him so
[05:39] shaq switches to the fade this was a
[05:43] go-to move for him for years
[05:45] often spinning to the baseline like this
[05:47] and because of his seven and a half foot
[05:49] wingspan and jumping ability he could
[05:51] fire this over giant defenders like
[05:54] arvida's sabonis
[05:56] he also had surprising range on this
[05:58] shot not quite to the foul line
[06:00] we'll get to that in a minute but out to
[06:02] about 12 or 13
[06:04] feet while he liked the drop step or
[06:07] that little turn around to his right
[06:09] he also had a jump hook over the other
[06:12] shoulder
[06:13] he's denied here on his cut across the
[06:15] lane which triggers that ball reversal
[06:17] but dale davis stays with him well and
[06:20] shaq just falls back on a huge jump hook
[06:24] it certainly was no sky hook shaq
[06:26] thought that shot was
[06:27] uncool but it was hard to defend given
[06:30] his size and speed off the
[06:33] between his hooks powerful spins and
[06:36] fadeaways
[06:37] shaq was an all-time great playoff
[06:39] scorer
[06:40] at his peak he posted some of the best
[06:42] adjusted numbers in league history
[06:44] trailing only michael jordan in number
[06:46] of stretches at this volume
[06:48] and doing so on similar efficiency i do
[06:52] think shaq added a different dimension
[06:54] with his off-ball
[06:55] game he racked up nearly 750 makes from
[06:59] close range in his mvp season
[07:01] an outlier since those records have been
[07:03] kept back to 1997
[07:05] and about two-thirds of those shots were
[07:08] assisted by
[07:09] teammates which lands him between the
[07:11] 75th and 80th percentile historically
[07:15] during the lakers repeat shaq didn't
[07:18] even
[07:18] attempt a shot outside of 15 feet in the
[07:21] playoffs
[07:22] and nearly half of his shots came right
[07:24] at the rim so he
[07:25] lived off a diet of the highest
[07:27] percentage attempts
[07:28] in the sport he added even more value
[07:32] without the ball
[07:33] as an offensive rebounder his low post
[07:36] positioning battles organically segued
[07:38] into offensive rebounding position
[07:40] here comes that cut across the lane it's
[07:43] jammed nicely but jackson lingers to
[07:45] double shack
[07:46] so now sam perkins has to help off him
[07:48] and the bull is loose
[07:50] in the china shop some of his prowess on
[07:54] the glass was just
[07:55] wedging himself near the hoop and out
[07:57] jumping people
[07:59] his 7-7 wingspan helped here and so did
[08:02] his incredible springiness
[08:04] for someone that size and he cleans up
[08:06] this mess with the
[08:08] sledgehammer again check out his feet on
[08:12] this play
[08:12] and how his twinkle toes let him reset
[08:15] into a bunny hop
[08:16] multiple times it was almost
[08:20] unfair to be so nimble at that size and
[08:23] boxing him out was unenviable
[08:25] and the shack proof basket works
[08:29] teams tried all kinds of tactics in the
[08:31] 2000 western finals
[08:33] portland went with the tag team holding
[08:35] method but even those kinds of tricks
[08:37] weren't foolproof
[08:40] okay that's not right let me hear you
[08:41] say that ain't right
[08:44] it ain't right that blazers team was
[08:47] really the only defense to slow down
[08:49] o'neill during the three-peat years
[08:51] swarming him regularly behind the giant
[08:53] arvida sabonis
[08:54] who was about seven foot three and three
[08:57] hundred pounds himself
[08:59] sabonis had the mass to keep shaq from
[09:02] completely overpowering him
[09:03] and the basketball iq to overplay that
[09:06] baseline move he
[09:08] loved he also tried to deny shaq's cut
[09:11] across the lane
[09:12] making him catch it three or four feet
[09:14] farther out
[09:16] and that makes a difference versus the
[09:17] diesel
[09:19] a more realistic way to slow shack down
[09:22] was to
[09:22] foul him there's the traditional method
[09:25] where he's in close
[09:26] or the legendary hackashack where teams
[09:29] intentionally fouled him at the end of
[09:31] the quarter
[09:32] it often felt like shaq was playing on a
[09:34] nerf hoop and the downside of that was
[09:36] at the line he
[09:37] shot a nerf ball i've never understood
[09:41] how deliberately fouling a 53
[09:43] free throw shooter was a winning play
[09:45] that would be
[09:46] great half court offense back in those
[09:48] days although when shaq was
[09:50] powering up next to the hoop 53 was
[09:53] way better than the 75 or so he shot at
[09:56] the rim
[09:58] because of this he put entire front
[10:00] lines into foul trouble
[10:02] forcing playoff teams to keep unskilled
[10:04] bruising bigs
[10:06] on their bench just to buy minutes
[10:08] against him
[10:10] so shaq's attack warped the entire game
[10:13] like
[10:14] few players ever have but were the other
[10:17] elements enough to make him the best
[10:19] center ever
[10:23] birthday present shaquille o'neal who
[10:25] turns 27 tomorrow not bad
[10:28] that's it from the forum i'm lauren
[10:29] sanchez back to you
[10:32] part of the benefit of shaq's positional
[10:34] sparring is that it led to
[10:36] quick hitting catch and shoot plays or
[10:38] in his case maybe i should say
[10:40] catching dunk plays and by scoring
[10:43] immediately
[10:44] he didn't take away many opportunities
[10:46] from teammates
[10:47] by monopolizing the ball if shaq
[10:50] wasn't in a position to catch and go one
[10:53] card he could play was the repost
[10:56] giving the ball up to find that superior
[10:57] position without dribbling
[11:00] this was a natural bridge between his
[11:02] scoring and playmaking
[11:04] where if he felt a double team in these
[11:06] spots he quickly kicked it out and could
[11:08] re-post
[11:09] but if that didn't lead to deeper
[11:10] position he'd play the same game
[11:13] again he was quite patient in these
[11:16] situations
[11:16] waiting for defenses to commit to
[11:18] blitzing him
[11:20] and he would move it to the direction
[11:21] the help came from to
[11:23] punish them if the double drop down from
[11:26] the top
[11:27] shaq surveyed and comfortably tossed it
[11:29] back out to a teammate
[11:32] if it came from the opposite corner
[11:34] right away he
[11:35] looked to that corner and in general he
[11:37] was really good at attacking the
[11:39] location of a double team
[11:41] alan iverson doubles off a different
[11:43] laker and shaq
[11:44] gashes it and then still cleans up the
[11:47] play himself with that
[11:48] rebounding he could work his way through
[11:51] progressions
[11:52] too here's a double from the top but new
[11:55] jersey shifts its defense to take away
[11:57] the basic kick out
[11:58] so shaq looks to the cutter and that's
[12:00] picked up well
[12:01] which leaves the skip pass to the
[12:03] opposite wing
[12:05] notice how he swivels his head when he
[12:07] catches an entry
[12:08] so he can see the action unfolding and
[12:11] find the optimal play
[12:13] and his processing speed in these spots
[12:15] was quite strong
[12:16] he spots the double before he lands here
[12:18] and then holds the defender with a no
[12:20] look
[12:21] pass again watch his head
[12:25] before the ball hits his hands he's
[12:26] surveying the floor
[12:28] so he knows the lane is open if his
[12:30] cutter has half a step
[12:31] and hooks up robert ore with perfect
[12:33] touch on a bounce pass
[12:36] shaq was willing to try tighter passes
[12:38] in the paint like this
[12:40] he sends this to open space in the
[12:42] middle of the lane
[12:43] with a little hop and a soft touch
[12:47] shaq was right hand dominant as a passer
[12:50] treating the basketball like a dodgeball
[12:52] and that led to
[12:54] some limitations or awkward deliveries
[12:56] at times
[12:57] he would occasionally throw one too hot
[13:00] or miss his target like this
[13:02] although he also had some brilliant
[13:04] deliveries
[13:05] too this looks like a skip pass but it's
[13:08] a change up that drops perfectly to a
[13:10] cutter and on this play he sees iverson
[13:14] fall asleep
[13:15] and those giant hands make this touch
[13:17] pass an easy
[13:18] bucket some speedy neurological
[13:21] processing
[13:22] also helped him audible at times he's
[13:25] flowing into a catch and shoot here
[13:26] but switches to a pass at the last
[13:29] second after spotting a double
[13:31] and as coach byrd can attest to that is
[13:34] just
[13:34] too good for my money
[13:37] shaq is the best low post passer among
[13:40] the great 90s centers
[13:42] but there were some holes in his vision
[13:44] he could miss
[13:45] openings on the opposite block he
[13:47] threads it once he
[13:48] sees horus grant but a great pass
[13:51] arrives two seconds earlier
[13:54] here's that same action again over
[13:56] shaq's left shoulder
[13:58] and he's blind to it and this is a
[14:00] connection that excellent postpassers
[14:02] make most of the time
[14:04] similarly he could also miss the
[14:06] baseline cut from the same side of the
[14:08] court
[14:08] and i think this is the trade-off of
[14:10] conditioning himself to spot the double
[14:13] team instead of holistically reading the
[14:15] floor
[14:16] he misses the easy layup here but is
[14:19] quick to hit a spot up shooter
[14:22] since he was quick to react to doubles
[14:24] his teammates had some
[14:26] wide open threes this is similar to what
[14:29] we saw last episode with akeem's rockets
[14:32] where surrounding him with capable
[14:33] shooters punished double teams
[14:36] and dotting the ark with these players
[14:37] and even a stretch four
[14:39] optimized shaq's inside out value
[14:43] outside of a white hot playoff run in
[14:45] 2001
[14:47] those lakers were never really a good
[14:49] three-point shooting team
[14:50] but they had enough respectable shooters
[14:53] on the court to space the floor
[14:55] and keep defenses honest which allowed a
[14:58] more defensively slanted supporting cast
[15:00] to play off shaq while maintaining those
[15:03] offensive heights
[15:05] as a result la's attacks were very good
[15:08] in the regular season
[15:09] and all-time good in the playoffs able
[15:12] to maintain their regular season
[15:14] efficiency
[15:15] against those super stingy playoff
[15:17] defenses
[15:18] of that era because almost no one had a
[15:21] way to slow down these shack centric
[15:23] offenses with shaq on the bench the
[15:26] lakers playoff offensive rating dropped
[15:28] by nearly
[15:28] 12 points during those three-peat runs
[15:31] to about
[15:32] 98 points per 100 even a
[15:35] young kobe bryant couldn't carry that
[15:37] kind of roster
[15:38] with a replacement level center subbed
[15:40] in for shaq
[15:42] although froby was a great fit next to
[15:44] o'neill
[15:45] he was already an elite offensive wing
[15:47] who could play make
[15:49] and generate his own shots with shaq
[15:52] probing for position teams were less
[15:54] likely to throw defensive attention
[15:56] toward kobe
[15:57] who already had a bevy of isolation
[16:00] scoring moves to unleash
[16:02] and because of shaquille's off-ball
[16:04] activity he didn't take away many
[16:06] touches from bryant o'neill fit
[16:08] incredibly well next to penetrators like
[16:11] this because his defenders were so
[16:13] reluctant to leave him near the hoop
[16:15] and this gave kobe a little more air
[16:17] space when attacking the cup
[16:19] when biggs were forced to help it freed
[16:22] up shaq on the glass for cleanup duty
[16:24] what a ridiculous duo they were i also
[16:27] think there was a strong fit on
[16:29] defense especially when bryant was at
[16:32] his defensive peak
[16:33] in the year 2000.
[16:39] shaq could be statuesque at times
[16:42] not venturing far from the lane and
[16:44] often dropping deep on pick and rolls
[16:46] and kobe's ability to chase ball
[16:48] handlers over screens
[16:50] and at times hound guards at the point
[16:52] of attack shored up o'neal's stationary
[16:55] defense
[16:56] and the diesel could be stuck in neutral
[16:58] for entire possessions
[17:00] he stretched that three second rule on
[17:02] both ends and despite kobe's ball denial
[17:05] on iverson here
[17:06] they still give up an open jumper
[17:10] there were a bunch of reasons why shaq
[17:11] just camped out in the key a lot
[17:13] first his defensive strength was
[17:15] protecting the rim
[17:17] especially against smaller wings who
[17:18] challenged his massive frame
[17:21] and his giant reach and when he was
[17:23] loaded up and in position to contest
[17:25] he could get to shots like this quickly
[17:29] second he was conserving energy it takes
[17:32] a lot to move
[17:33] 340 pounds around the court and
[17:35] shaquille was asked to play
[17:37] 43 minutes per game in the playoffs at
[17:39] his peak
[17:40] and in his condition he lacked the motor
[17:42] to do that
[17:43] while stepping out to the perimeter on
[17:45] defense
[17:46] or even sitting down in a stance and
[17:49] moving more in tight spaces
[17:53] there were a number of instances where
[17:55] he was slow getting back in transition
[17:58] jogging down the court at a leisurely
[18:00] pace
[18:01] and in some instances he never really
[18:03] made it back into the play
[18:05] and in their playoff matchups the kings
[18:07] had some success
[18:09] running him until fatigue kicked in also
[18:12] shaq parked himself in the paint because
[18:15] his change of direction wasn't swift
[18:17] enough
[18:17] to make recovering easy and he wasn't
[18:20] fast enough to help down from the
[18:22] outside
[18:23] like the last two centers in this series
[18:26] on offense he could dictate where all
[18:29] that
[18:29] mass went but having to react on defense
[18:32] wasn't
[18:33] as easy he's not agile enough to toggle
[18:36] around here smoothly
[18:38] and kind of bear hugs his man and ends
[18:41] up on the wrong side of the play
[18:44] all this was compounded by inconsistent
[18:46] awareness where on some plays he was a
[18:49] bit
[18:49] slow to read potential threats and on
[18:52] others he was sort of asleep at the
[18:54] wheel with a
[18:54] play unfolding in front of him
[18:58] this shows up when we look at how
[19:00] opposing teams
[19:01] shot at the rim when o'neill was on the
[19:03] court opponents shot
[19:04] slightly worse than average in 2000 and
[19:07] at
[19:08] exactly average in 2001 which is a far
[19:11] cry from elite defensive big men
[19:13] like the spurs twin towers or the
[19:16] georgetown centers
[19:18] on the plus side teams didn't take too
[19:20] many of these high percentage shots in
[19:22] the restricted area
[19:23] against o'neill probably due to his
[19:25] intimidation
[19:27] in other words there was some benefit to
[19:29] him lingering in the lane
[19:31] many opponents didn't want to challenge
[19:33] shaq's shot blocking
[19:35] or take the physical punishment he could
[19:37] dish out on hard fouls
[19:40] on occasion he would shift into fifth
[19:42] gear and
[19:43] string together really active defensive
[19:46] possessions
[19:46] leaving the paint moving his feet and
[19:49] giving us a glimpse at what his defense
[19:51] would
[19:52] have looked like with a high revving
[19:53] motor
[19:55] of course most of the time he roamed
[19:57] around the lane like a grazing elephant
[20:00] so teams with jump shooting big men
[20:02] would punish him on the perimeter
[20:05] shack did not want to switch onto wings
[20:08] and was reluctant to come out on them
[20:10] here la sends extra help and it leads to
[20:12] a clean three
[20:13] and teams would go at him in pick and
[20:16] roll
[20:17] leaving his teammates on an island
[20:18] against the screener and ball handler
[20:21] and shaq's reluctance to venture out
[20:23] helped allen iverson in his famous 2001
[20:26] outburst
[20:27] and the ultimate example of this was
[20:29] mike bibby's pull-up jumper parade
[20:31] in the 2002 western finals that nearly
[20:35] unseated the lakers this also made it
[20:38] really easy for big men
[20:40] to pick and pop their way into wide open
[20:42] jumpers
[20:43] so when teams started torching la like
[20:45] this they would bring shaq up to the
[20:48] level of the screen
[20:49] where he could contest pull-ups this was
[20:52] actually a major
[20:53] tactical adjustment in that big game 7
[20:55] comeback in 2000 against portland
[20:58] and there's one of those high-energy
[20:59] defensive possessions
[21:02] note that most of these shots then were
[21:04] long twos
[21:05] because there weren't many pull up three
[21:06] practitioners in the league at that
[21:08] point
[21:10] in 2000 and 2001 the lakers posted
[21:13] a 103 defensive rating without shaq on
[21:16] the court
[21:17] slightly ahead of league average with
[21:19] him they were about 2 points better
[21:21] and more complex adjustments for
[21:23] teammates and opponent quality
[21:26] view him as a solid positive on defense
[21:28] in those seasons although not a star
[21:32] we see a similar story looking at his
[21:34] missed games the same method we used
[21:36] back in episode 2
[21:38] where in 25 contests as the only starter
[21:41] missing
[21:41] la was almost a 500 team but when shaq
[21:45] returned to the lineup they played at a
[21:46] 62-win
[21:48] pace most of that change was on offense
[21:52] equally as impressive is how the lakers
[21:54] fared without kobe in those years
[21:56] in 29 games where he was the only
[21:58] starter missing
[21:59] la played at a 54 win pace with an
[22:02] offense nearly three points ahead of the
[22:05] league
[22:06] and that's without a playmaker replacing
[22:08] bryant a testament to shaq's offensive
[22:10] floor raising
[22:11] with a three and d roster similarly one
[22:15] number impact metrics rank him among the
[22:17] all-time greats
[22:18] primarily because of his offensive value
[22:22] to me there's enough value from that
[22:24] paint protection
[22:26] for him to be a decently positive
[22:28] defender he was even somewhat effective
[22:30] as a man defender during those years
[22:32] just based on his size and sheer
[22:34] athleticism
[22:35] and the overall nature of his offense
[22:38] which was off ball
[22:40] quick hitting and so difficult to slow
[22:43] down
[22:43] made him unique among big men in nba
[22:46] history
[22:47] and gives him a strong argument as the
[22:50] most
[22:51] dominant big man ever

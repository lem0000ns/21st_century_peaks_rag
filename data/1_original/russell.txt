[00:00] 
[00:00] lebron james is the greatest player i
[00:01] don't ever want to hear
[00:03] anybody tell me that he is number one
[00:05] michael george is number two
[00:12] the greatest of all time the goat debate
[00:16] it dominates the conversation today but
[00:18] the original goat debate captivated
[00:20] basketball back in the 1960s
[00:23] back then the hoops world was divided
[00:25] into two camps
[00:26] one side argued for will chamberlain
[00:29] based on his outlying statistical
[00:30] achievements
[00:31] and the other for bill russell who
[00:33] collected an astounding 11
[00:35] championship rings but what if that
[00:38] whole paradigm is
[00:39] backwards what if we threw russell's
[00:41] rings out the window
[00:43] used wilt stats against him and made the
[00:46] statistical case
[00:47] for russell over chamber
[00:49] [Music]

[00:55] where's larry bird in all this
[00:59] [Applause]
[01:02] this series tackles one question who was
[01:05] the best
[01:06] at his best we start at the aba merger
[01:09] and go through the best
[01:10] multi-year stretches examining the
[01:12] legends who provided the most on-court
[01:14] impact these are the greatest
[01:18] peaks
[01:24] before we dive into specific years and
[01:26] criteria we'll do that at the end of
[01:28] this episode
[01:29] wilt and russell illustrate something at
[01:31] the heart of this series and basketball
[01:34] itself
[01:35] in 1962 chamberlain famously averaged 50
[01:39] points and 25 rebounds per game
[01:41] while playing every minute of every game
[01:44] many consider it to be
[01:46] the most dominant season in nba history
[01:49] i don't think it's one of the hundred
[01:50] best seasons
[01:52] that may sound crazy but those 50 points
[01:55] came with a
[01:56] lot of caveats for one there were way
[01:59] 
[01:59] more scoring chances back in 1962
[02:02] teams ran up and down to the tune of
[02:04] about 130 possessions per game
[02:07] that's about 30 more chances to rack up
[02:10] stats than in a typical game today
[02:12] more shots more free throws rebounds and
[02:14] so on we examined this stat inflation
[02:17] last year
[02:17] but the takeaway here is that 50 points
[02:19] per game then
[02:21] isn't what we'd think of as 50 points
[02:22] per game in the three-point era
[02:24] maybe the easiest way to see this is to
[02:26] note that wilt scored about
[02:28] 40 percent of his team's points that
[02:30] season while he was on the court
[02:32] whereas michael jordan and kobe bryant
[02:34] scored about 43 percent of their team's
[02:36] points
[02:37] when on the court during their mega
[02:39] scoring seasons
[02:40] wilt also played the entire game which
[02:43] gave him a few extra minutes of impact
[02:45] but also made his rate of scoring less
[02:48] impressive
[02:48] the dipper scored about 29 points every
[02:51] 75 possessions he played that year
[02:53] which would rank seventh this season so
[02:56] a huge number but not a historical
[02:58] outlier okay but so what you might say
[03:01] even with stat inflation wilt still
[03:04] crushed russell as a scorer
[03:06] right and he did russell's scoring rate
[03:08] was actually below league average for
[03:10] most of his career
[03:12] but the question here isn't who scored
[03:14] more points per game
[03:16] it's how much did these players help
[03:17] their teams score more efficiently
[03:20] playmaking is the other enormous driver
[03:22] of offensive impact
[03:23] making life easier for all four of your
[03:25] teammates not just yourself
[03:28] and will chamberlain was the original
[03:30] black hole
[03:32] it wasn't that he couldn't pass or that
[03:33] he never set up his running mates
[03:35] it's that he very rarely set them up
[03:38] relative to how much he shot
[03:40] if we look at true shot attempts that is
[03:43] when a player took a field goal or
[03:44] attempted two free throws
[03:46] and compare those scoring attempts to
[03:48] assists
[03:49] we can see just how little wilt was play
[03:51] 
[03:51] making
[03:52] here are all the non-chamberlain seasons
[03:54] since the shot clock with at least 20
[03:56] true shot attempts per 75 possessions
[03:59] now here's wilt in the first half of his
[04:01] career
[04:02] he scored more while passing less than
[04:05] just about anyone
[04:06] ever and that was a criticism of him at
[04:08] the time
[04:09] it was common to hear refrains like this
[04:11] from sports illustrated in 1966.
[04:14] 
[04:15] but the tactical demands of using wilt
[04:17] to his best advantage
[04:19] that's scoring by the way severely
[04:20] diminish his team's own versatility
[04:23] and generally create more out problems
[04:24] among those who want the ball as much as
[04:26] he does
[04:27] now let's go back to that graph and add
[04:29] his 50-point season
[04:31] it is an outlier among
[04:34] outliers this has been hiding in plain
[04:36] sight for
[04:37] 60 years and the names of those who have
[04:40] even gone over
[04:41] 15 to 1 should drive home just how
[04:44] one-dimensional his offense was
[04:46] the only players to cross that threshold
[04:48] in the last decade
[04:49] were brooke lopez in brooklyn and
[04:51] kristaps porzingis in 2018
[04:54] the takeaway here is that wilt's sexy
[04:56] scoring numbers
[04:58] were mostly one-dimensional and there's
[05:00] only so much you can help your team
[05:02] without making life easier for teammates
[05:05] because of that nba axiom chamberlain's
[05:08] team's offenses weren't very good during
[05:10] those volume scoring seasons
[05:12] they were most efficient in 1962 scoring
[05:15] about two points more per hundred than
[05:17] league average
[05:18] but every other season they were around
[05:20] average with chamberlain registering
[05:22] huge numbers in 1965
[05:25] his team had the worst offense in the
[05:27] league by a mile before he was traded
[05:29] and wilt averaged 39 points per game
[05:32] on solid efficiency that year this
[05:35] pattern has actually held throughout nba
[05:37] history
[05:38] huge volume scoring doesn't guarantee a
[05:40] good offense
[05:42] it can help lift teams to competitive
[05:44] levels
[05:45] raising their floor if you will but
[05:47] there are endless combinations of talent
[05:49] that can make an nba offense slightly
[05:51] below
[05:51] average besides dumping it into an
[05:53] isolation score
[05:54] 40 of the time in 1965
[05:56] 
[05:58] wilt was traded to the philadelphia
[05:59] 76ers for their
[06:01] fifth and eighth man and philadelphia
[06:04] improved from around 500 play
[06:06] to about a 48 win pace we don't know how
[06:09] much of this improvement was a much
[06:11] needed defensive boost
[06:12] but again big scoring alone didn't
[06:15] create a good
[06:16] offense wilt's team offenses actually
[06:18] 
[06:19] improved when he finally
[06:21] shot less way less actually
[06:24] few players in nba history have
[06:26] downshifted so
[06:27] severely as a scorer going from a
[06:30] shooting machine to leading the nba in
[06:32] assists
[06:33] in his second full season with the 76ers
[06:36] wilt's scoring rate dropped almost down
[06:38] to
[06:38] russell levels and his team's offense
[06:40] exploded
[06:42] there's an enormous negative correlation
[06:44] between chamberlain's scoring rates
[06:46] and his team's offensive success the
[06:48] less he shot
[06:50] the better they did that doesn't mean
[06:52] his volume shooting
[06:53] hurt his team but it does suggest that
[06:55] it was holding back his better teammates
[06:57] otherwise why did his coach completely
[07:00] change his style
[07:01] with better players around him russell
[07:04] on the other hand was never seen as an
[07:06] offensive force
[07:07] but instead is the benefactor of great
[07:10] teammates
[07:10] koozie and heinzen at first then sam
[07:13] jones and john havlicek
[07:14] but there's an enormous problem with
[07:17] that idea
[07:19] if there's one thing that hasn't changed
[07:21] in the nba over the years
[07:23] it's that most all-star players are
[07:25] recognized for their
[07:26] offense this includes those celtics
[07:28] around bill russell and it's often said
[07:30] that his bandmates made boston
[07:32] a dynasty but the celtics weren't
[07:34] actually overflowing with all-star
[07:36] talent then
[07:37] here are the all-star appearances by
[07:39] 
[07:39] team during boston's perfect run from
[07:42] to 1959-1966 excluding russell and wilt
[07:46] does any club jump out as being
[07:48] completely stacked with all-stars if
[07:50] wilt or russell were to join them
[07:52] if anything the lakers behind jerry west
[07:54] and elgin baylor
[07:55] two of the five best players of the
[07:57] period themselves look like the most
[07:59] top-heavy team if we add russell to the
[08:02] celtics
[08:02] they end up with the most all-stars but
[08:05] wilt's teams weren't lagging
[08:06] far behind so a bunch of franchises had
[08:09] two or three all-star players typically
[08:12] based on offensive play
[08:14] and since russell's supporting cast was
[08:15] no different it should come as no
[08:17] surprise that boston's offense was
[08:19] around average or even below average for
[08:22] most of the 1960s
[08:24] instead those celtics teams won with
[08:27] defense
[08:28] during russell's time in boston he
[08:30] spearheaded the greatest defensive
[08:32] dynasty the league has ever seen
[08:34] strangling opponents night after night
[08:36] with a timeless combination of size
[08:39] speed mobility and awareness boston
[08:42] ultimately incorporated solid defensive
[08:44] teammates to platoon around big bill
[08:47] but he was the driving force behind a
[08:49] club that allowed the fewest points per
[08:51] possession in the league
[08:52] in 11 of his 13 seasons and while most
[08:55] of the nba was struggling to reach 50
[08:57] wins at the time due to parody
[08:59] russell's celtics were an outlier
[09:02] cranking out 60 win seasons
[09:04] these circles represent every team's
[09:05] 
[09:07] defensive efficiency relative to the
[09:08] league
[09:09] since 1955. the year before russell
[09:12] arrived
[09:13] boston had the worst defense in the
[09:15] league statistically giving up an
[09:16] estimated
[09:17] 3 points more than lee average with
[09:20] russell they jumped to the top of the
[09:22] league
[09:22] and would steadily improve as 1950s
[09:24] names faded
[09:26] and were replaced by stronger and more
[09:27] athletic defenders in 1961.
[09:30] at their peak in 1964 boston was nearly
[09:34] 10 points better per 100 than other
[09:36] teams on that end
[09:37] arguably the greatest defensive season
[09:40] ever
[09:41] as russell aged and the nba expanded
[09:43] boston remained competitive with its
[09:45] defense
[09:46] until he retired at 35 and then
[09:48] immediately fell
[09:49] back to the pack all told russell
[09:52] captained
[09:53] 5 of the 25 best defensive seasons in
[09:56] league history
[09:57] in a row an unrivaled team
[10:00] accomplishment
[10:01] without a three-point line and primitive
[10:03] spacing that allowed big men to patrol
[10:05] the paint
[10:05] as a backstop a versatile vertical
[10:08] defender
[10:09] like russell became the game's most
[10:11] valuable weapon
[10:13] boston's ascension to record-setting
[10:15] defense coincided with russell playing
[10:17] more minutes
[10:18] with a platoon of players around him at
[10:20] their apex no other celtic logged more
[10:22] than 33 minutes per night
[10:24] and boston's final resurgence in 1969
[10:27] came with russell re-upping his minutes
[10:29] alongside boston's best offensive player
[10:32] at the time john havelchek many people
[10:35] talk about
[10:35] wilt dominating russell heads up because
[10:38] he scored more than bill
[10:40] in their 142 meetings on record
[10:43] chamberlain averaged over 28 points per
[10:45] game on 51
[10:46] true shooting compared to just 14 points
[10:49] per game on 42 percent true shooting for
[10:52] russ
[10:52] but russell's primary value didn't come
[10:55] from his scoring
[10:56] he won five mvps because he made scoring
[10:59] harder
[11:00] for the opposition and chamberlain was
[11:02] no exception
[11:03] against everyone else wilt averaged 34
[11:06] points per game
[11:07] on 54 true shooting so russell gave him
[11:10] a
[11:11] major haircut denting his scoring and
[11:14] efficiency
[11:14] you might think sure but wilt's numbers
[11:17] are still great
[11:18] but remember his scoring didn't make his
[11:20] team's offense very potent in the first
[11:22] place
[11:23] so russell was blunting what was only a
[11:25] moderately sharp weapon to begin with
[11:28] imparting that massive defensive impact
[11:30] that drove boston to title after title
[11:33] every spring
[11:34] and when chamberlain was going hog wild
[11:36] trying to score in 1962
[11:38] russell gave him a larger haircut in
[11:41] 
[11:41] these 75
[11:42] games wilt didn't face bill he averaged
[11:44] 51 points per night
[11:46] on 54 true shooting against russell
[11:50] he averaged 37 points per game
[11:53] on 50 true shooting that would rank 11th
[11:57] this year
[11:57] in permanent scoring similar to paul
[12:00] george in volume and efficiency
[12:03] if there were stats like opponent field
[12:05] goal percentage in the paint
[12:07] or how much did you hold players below
[12:09] their average
[12:10] pundits might have viewed russell's
[12:12] performances against wilt as being
[12:14] dominant
[12:15] but those stats didn't exist so
[12:16] russell's continued success
[12:18] forced people then to search for
[12:20] explanations beyond scoring
[12:23] some people like to credit his
[12:24] intangibles as a leader
[12:26] and others are more dismissive looking
[12:28] to his teammates as the reason for their
[12:30] success
[12:31] we don't have precise measuring tools
[12:34] for that period
[12:35] but if we look at the 28 games russell
[12:37] missed between 1958 and 1969
[12:40] the celtics played at a 35 win pace
[12:43] without him
[12:44] and a 59 win pace when he played that's
[12:47] super duper impact especially compared
[12:50] to the changes we saw when
[12:52] wilt shifted teams but remember these
[12:54] are crude measuring tools
[12:56] another more comprehensive approach is
[12:58] 
[12:58] to also account for teammates who have
[13:00] gone in and out of the lineup over the
[13:01] years
[13:02] by looking at how his teammates impacted
[13:04] teams when they were in and out of the
[13:05] lineup
[13:06] and so on and so forth we did something
[13:08] just like this in part five of the
[13:10] thinking basketball stats series
[13:12] and when we solve this giant equation
[13:15] to estimate a player's overall value
[13:18] looking at just the final score and who
[13:21] played in the game
[13:22] russell comes out ahead of wilt
[13:26] this is a noisy calculation it's
[13:28] possible that in reality
[13:29] these players could be worth a few
[13:31] points more or a few points less per
[13:33] game than these studies conclude
[13:35] but consider how amazing this is the
[13:38] only thing this metric uses
[13:40] is who played and what the score was and
[13:43] yet
[13:44] its top 25 players claimed three
[13:46] quarters of the available mvps
[13:48] and averaged 13 all-star appearances
[13:51] per player and again it says that when
[13:54] we ignore the box score
[13:56] and focus on the relationship between
[13:57] the scoreboard and the player
[13:59] that bill russell is actually better
[14:01] than will chamberlain
[14:03] that's incredible to me even if it's not
[14:05] a definitive proof
[14:06] and all of this has significant
[14:08] ramifications for the idea of number one
[14:10] options we typically think about them as
[14:13] the best offensive player on a team
[14:15] but a great defender like russell can be
[14:17] the best player on his team by
[14:19] far without being the best or even
[14:21] second best offensive player
[14:24] this was often the norm before the aba
[14:26] nba merger in 1977
[14:28] and while it's rare today because rule
[14:31] changes have helped elite offensive
[14:32] players
[14:33] while chipping away at elite defensive
[14:35] impact tim duncan's spurs
[14:37] kevin garnett's celtics and arguably ben
[14:39] wallace's pistons
[14:41] are examples of recent teams where the
[14:43] best overall player
[14:44] wasn't head and shoulders the best
[14:46] offensive player
[14:48] if we return to those impact studies
[14:49] that looked at who played
[14:51] and what the score was we see something
[14:52] 
[14:54] fascinating
[14:55] among the top 20 players a handful are
[14:58] primarily playmakers
[15:00] a handful are primarily scorers who are
[15:02] also plentiful playmakers
[15:04] and another handful are defensive titans
[15:08] what's so telling to me is that this
[15:10] metric isn't influenced by any of our
[15:12] ideas of
[15:13] scoring first and second options or even
[15:16] defense
[15:17] and yet it's littered with at least four
[15:19] completely different types of players
[15:21] if we use modern play-by-play data to
[15:23] generate a more stable look at this kind
[15:26] of scoreboard only impact again we'd see
[15:29] the exact same results hold
[15:31] it's a player's overall impact that
[15:34] matters in basketball
[15:35] and that comes in so many different
[15:37] combinations
[15:39] in many ways wilt and russell are the
[15:41] original example of this
[15:42] philosophical loggerheads with
[15:44] chamberlain bringing
[15:45] offensive and defensive impact and
[15:48] russell trying to outpace him
[15:49] mostly with his giant defensive value
[15:52] isolation scoring like
[15:54] chamberlain's can be impressive to watch
[15:56] and helpful for teams starved of scoring
[15:58] threats
[15:59] but it can also prevent other offensive
[16:01] talents from flourishing
[16:03] in the absence of playmaking that means
[16:05] i'll be working off the following
[16:07] criteria for this
[16:08] series first this series is about
[16:10] 
[16:11] basketball impact on the court we'll
[16:14] contextualize circumstances and
[16:16] philosophies
[16:16] but factors like aesthetic appeal aren't
[16:19] outside of the scope here
[16:21] second i care about someone's overall
[16:24] impact
[16:24] specifically how much they can help a
[16:26] team win championships
[16:28] that means skills that scale up to
[16:30] better teams
[16:31] tend to matter more than skills that
[16:33] can't mesh with other
[16:34] top flight players third were starting
[16:37] in 1977
[16:39] when the leagues merged while the game
[16:41] continues to evolve
[16:42] the size of the league and its
[16:44] competitiveness are similar since the
[16:46] merger
[16:47] making for fair comparisons which will
[16:50] be made
[16:50] relative to the league in a given year
[16:53] there are no time machines here
[16:55] instead we're trying to understand how
[16:57] much a player
[16:58] impacted the game given the rules and
[17:01] practices of that
[17:02] time and finally those peaks must
[17:05] contain
[17:05] multiple consecutive seasons the key
[17:08] reason for this approach is to avoid
[17:10] fluky single season outcomes and to
[17:13] increase the breadth of information to
[17:16] evaluate a player
[17:17] at the end of this series we'll revisit
[17:19] how all these guys stack up
[17:21] but otherwise the episodes will flow
[17:23] roughly in chronological order
[17:25] profiling the greatest peaks in nba
[17:29] history if you're interested in
[17:31] isolation scoring in greater detail
[17:33] and specifically wilts it's a main theme
[17:36] in thinking basketball the book
[17:37] and chronicled in the back picks top 40
[17:39] series russell and chamberlain would
[17:41] certainly be featured in a great peak
[17:43] series that went back to the shot clock
[17:45] along with the 260s megastars oscar
[17:47] robertson and jerry west
[17:49] but due to a lack of footage and data
[17:51] they're difficult to compare on even
[17:53] ground

[00:00] traditional nba superstars have either been really really tall or really really
[00:05] athletic every other player in this series is at least six foot five
[00:10] except for this guy wardell stephen curry is rightfully considered the greatest
[00:17] shooter in nba history but just how good can someone be with
[00:22] outliers shooting how much did his lack of classic athleticism hold him back on
[00:28] defense and was his radical offensive approach so game changing that it made him the most
[00:35] valuable offensive player of all time
[00:43] where's larry bird in all this has it blocked by elijah michael jordan saves the day this series
[00:50] tackles one question who was the best at his best we start at the aba merger and go
[00:57] through the best multi-year stretches examining the legends who provided the most on court impact
[01:03] these are the greatest peaks
[01:12] i liked it but i was more interested in basketball at the time so um it was more my sport kind of um
[01:20] i had more uh i was kind of better at it it's basketball and i wanted to um practice
[01:25] some more on it and um try to make it to the frozen chance the other offensive greats we've looked
[01:32] at in this series found a way to pressure the rim while also getting to their sweet spots
[01:38] kareem had his sky hook jordan had mid-range pull-ups but curry short-circuited the entire
[01:45] system he didn't park himself in the most valuable spot like shaq and he didn't charge toward the basket
[01:51] like lebron instead he turned the three-point line into his own personal layup
[01:58] from 2016 to 19 curry made nearly 50 percent of his open threes that's the
[02:05] equivalent of a 73 percent two-point shot efficiency that only incredible rim finishers can
[02:11] generate but instead of being limited to the restricted area to produce this kind of
[02:16] efficiency he could manufacture his long-range layups from all over the court curry became a
[02:24] real life video game a custom player with 99 shooting who started spamming threes from 28 feet
[02:31] away like there was a glitch in the matrix it was only slightly better for
[02:36] defenders when they were a touch closer at four to six feet away he made 43 of his threes the equivalent of a
[02:44] mere 65 percent from two point range other players have shot at comparable
[02:50] percentages but curry set himself apart with the obscene volume at which he could
[02:55] manufacture these attempts it starts with his release speed which is the quickest that espn sports science
[03:02] has ever clocked around four tenths of a second on some of these shots
[03:07] in less time than it takes to say basketball curry ends his dribble and has the shot
[03:13] out of his hands so instead of using verticality to keep his shot away from defenders
[03:18] he used speed so they can't close the distance horizontally
[03:24] this is how he can get his shot off from all over the court even when guarded by bigger defenders
[03:30] curry even has crazy release speed in catch-and-shoot situations taking around two-thirds of a second to
[03:36] grab a pass and turn it into a shot and this could be even faster on perfect
[03:42] passes because he tried to catch it while he was squared up to the basket ready to shoot by the way his dad
[03:49] dell also had some lightning quick releases back in the 90s although at six foot two steph was even
[03:56] shorter so his release speed was even more important another reason he's able to generate so
[04:03] many of these quality threes is his range he's comfortable shooting his
[04:09] normal shot out to at least 30 feet which means there are a few hundred square feet on the court where
[04:15] an open steph curry 3 is highly efficient offense there have been scientific breakdowns of this as
[04:22] well and the key to his long range accuracy is minimal knee bend which limits the
[04:28] variability in his shot mechanics this creates a consistent energy transfer off the floor
[04:35] where curry flexes his wrist harder at the end of the movement to control the distance giving him an
[04:41] incredibly stable shot from well beyond the line another skill
[04:46] that separated steph from so many great shooters was his handle his dribbling sets up so
[04:52] many of these shots by helping him probe for superior shooting spots on the floor he had all the building
[04:59] blocks of a great ball handler he loved little in and outs like this this one creates a ton of space
[05:05] into the step back and it turns into free throws and he had the full arsenal of through
[05:12] the legs behind the back crossovers or sharp crosses in front of his body to shake defenders
[05:18] he likes to throw combinations a second behind the back bounce buckles kevin durant and leads to a
[05:24] layup and this was more audacious an in and out into the behind the back in traffic and the sweet finish for an
[05:31] and one see it works every time he blended hesitations with sharp hard
[05:37] dribbles staying over his center of gravity to accelerate in any direction
[05:44] steph didn't really lean much on these moves keeping weight in both feet for quick changes of direction
[05:50] after his dribble which meant he could do this on the run right there and create a little opening from
[05:56] deep to pull up from the threat of these pull-ups from anywhere
[06:02] opened up his drives he looks at the hoop and brings that right hand toward the ball like he's going to shoot
[06:08] which fakes out james harden and sets up penetration into the paint and sometimes he could lift
[06:15] defenders off their feet by merely looking at the basket kevin love lunges at him which gets curry free
[06:21] but again he can't finish it steph's small stature made finishing in traffic a tricky
[06:28] endeavor he destroys gerald henderson but another wing sliding over alters his
[06:33] shot this time he uses that fake step back by looking at the hoop
[06:39] but he sees traffic in the lane and pulls up early which ends up in a rejection from behind
[06:45] these little pull-ups could be an effective counter love crowds him so tightly he only needs
[06:51] a first step and a soft banker from about eight feet does the trick curry wasn't
[06:56] lightning quick but with defenders so far out worried about his shot he could get a step and once he turns
[07:03] the corner here he picks it up for a long distance scoop most attackers take
[07:08] an additional dribble in these spots to explode upwards but he couldn't win verticality contests
[07:14] so he relied on ambidextrous touch these longer
[07:19] higher arcing layups aren't quite as easy as taking it all the way to the cup but curry's outlier hand-eye
[07:26] coordination helped him convert these kinds of finishes regularly when there wasn't a second defender that
[07:33] handle let him attack guards and flip up little shots like this and
[07:38] some of these were just incredible finishes making circus shots look like no big deal these could even work
[07:46] against shot blockers a crossover into a shot fake that freezes the defender briefly
[07:52] and sets up the huge teardrop off the glass this is similar to what we saw from
[07:57] larry bird in episode 4 where creative adaptive skill
[08:02] offsets a lack of verticality curry brings the ball far away from the defender
[08:08] and his body and has the concentration to take one in the face and still finish since defenses couldn't
[08:16] give steph any air space on ball screens big men often switched on to him so when
[08:21] he was able to get a step he could use his body to protect himself from larger shot blockers this came in two forms
[08:29] he could either angle back into the path of the defender or when a shot blocker was in pursuit he
[08:36] could decelerate and create contact despite weighing around 190
[08:42] pounds he could take it right at much bigger players sometimes and these moments where he embraced
[08:48] physicality on hard drives not only helped him finish but gave him a respectable free throw rate
[08:54] for someone who relied so much on shooting and ball skills curry's bag of tricks
[09:00] made him a pretty good rim finisher and an especially good one for a point guard
[09:05] tony parker is the historical gold standard among little guys but steph wasn't too far off in terms of
[09:12] volume or efficiency sometimes he'd mix in mid-range shots
[09:17] stopping on a dime on one of these drives but only about 10 percent of his offense came off of two pointers outside of 10
[09:24] feet like this curry's style organically bypassed the mid-range because he was either hunting
[09:31] for threes half of his offense came from downtown or driving by defenders who chased him
[09:37] far away from the basket steph took three-point hunting to a new level
[09:42] becoming more dangerous after passing it which brings us to the fourth and final reason
[09:48] he generated so many great attempts his off-ball movement
[09:53] many great shooters run around without the ball but curry took the art to a new level
[09:59] his most notable contribution to the field was the relocation shot where he'd pass
[10:04] it and then immediately run out to the three-point line for a catch and shoot triple
[10:10] being so dangerous with a live dribble made so many of these possible he could attack off the bounce for a
[10:16] pull-up or finish into traffic but steph passed it so we could just keep looking around
[10:22] for higher percentage shots even without the ball remember big men often switched out onto
[10:29] him and they weren't used to clinging to their marks after a pass and those brief lulls created more 24
[10:35] foot layups for the human torch of course curry had all the classic off-ball routes too
[10:42] curling off screens right into a bomb and he was a master at using picks walking defenders
[10:49] right into his teammate and jutting out the other side for open looks when teams overplayed the top side to
[10:56] take away the three he had incredible feel for slipping back door and then a minute later that back door
[11:03] sets up a counter cut back out to the three-point line and that's just wrong
[11:10] if you're interested in more curry cuts and the power of off-ball movement there's an entire video about it on this
[11:16] channel in addition to having every off-ball move in the book steph just never stopped moving
[11:24] which basically made him a threat to score all the time and because he ran around so much curry
[11:31] was an all-time great endurance athlete training not just his lungs but his nervous system to be able to stroke
[11:38] these shots on autopilot even with fatigued legs
[11:44] despite this atypical approach all of this made him one of history's great scorers
[11:49] and curry authored the greatest scoring regular season ever becoming the only player in the
[11:56] three-point era to lead the league in scoring volume and in scoring efficiency of course the
[12:04] possessions where curry wasn't scoring had an enormous effect as well
[12:09] because steph required unique defensive attention that the league had never seen
[12:19] bring home the bacon dead now you're cooking then smooth mixing after his record-setting
[12:28] regular season in 2016 curry hit a rough patch in the playoffs quite
[12:33] literally spraining his mcl he returned a few weeks later and while his numbers were still good
[12:40] they were a step down from his blazing regular season performance the cavs wanted to be physical with
[12:47] curry in the finals bumping him away from the ball whenever they had the chance with the intention of wearing him down
[12:55] big men chipped him when he ran by and curry's man harassed him while nearly ignoring
[13:01] the on ball action the goal was to take away steph's threes and force his teammates to make them
[13:08] and these curry rules of physically face guarding him while a second defender
[13:13] also put a body on him led to 11 fewer touches per game for steph
[13:19] denting his scoring volume in the process when curry had the ball they jumped his
[13:25] screens hard or simply trapped him so he was forced to give it up and this led to wide open
[13:31] shots but steph's teammates shot a chilly 28 from downtown with him on the court
[13:38] in the finals by the way other teams mimicked these tactics in the ensuing years
[13:44] and curry responded by gaining some muscle to help absorb this kind of physical load
[13:51] so that cleveland defense had an effect but steph also lost some of his rhythm and
[13:57] lateral quickness by playing through pain and some stiffness after that injury and his normal ability
[14:04] to punish big men on some of these switches was noticeably absent at times in that series
[14:10] he wasn't sharp handling some of those cavalier traps throwing a few lazy passes and turnovers
[14:17] were a problem for him in general even with fantastic ball
[14:22] handling he could be a bit sloppy at times and his dribbling aggression came with some risks
[14:30] whether this was more rust or game planning curry's playoff scoring wasn't quite as
[14:35] otherworldly as his regular season stampedes which still made him an all-time level scorer just not an
[14:43] outlier so much of defending curry is about what's happening away from the action and that kind of
[14:50] defensive attention leads to open shots for the warriors this is curry's legendary
[14:56] gravity pulling extra defenders into his orbit even when he didn't have the ball and
[15:03] this is a sizable part of his offensive impact drawing the defense away from his
[15:08] teammates as they freak out about his shooting the price to pay for devoting so many
[15:15] resources to stopping steph's scoring was wide open layups at the hoop well
[15:20] defense is fixated on curry and people often point out that
[15:25] these defenders are merely confused which is true because guarding curry creates
[15:32] confusion the margin for error is minuscule sometimes it's not even confusion the
[15:39] jazz devote the entire weak side to keeping an eye on curry and even with three defenders they will
[15:46] concede a draymond green triple before losing steph some gravity
[15:52] is more subtle lebron would normally be closer to the block on the weak side
[15:57] but he's whispering sweet somethings in steph's ear in the corner here's some relocation gravity where
[16:05] none of these defenders are even thinking about closing out to clay thompson one of humanity's best shooters of the
[16:11] round ball and sometimes defenders start anticipating what to do
[16:16] and that leads to more layups these kinds of plays are exactly how a
[16:22] so-called jump shooting team can lead the league in field goal percentage at the rim
[16:29] we noted last episode how curry made life easier for duran and nothing symbolizes this better than
[16:36] the second quarter of the 2017 finals where curry parted the seas for him not
[16:41] once but twice in transition steph's shooting accuracy changed the rules on
[16:48] the fast break where defenders prioritized him over guarding the ball at times
[16:55] the traditional approach of sprinting back to the paint didn't work with him because they ended up leading to
[17:01] practice shots reggie miller was the first player to regularly run to the three-point line in
[17:06] transition but curry couldn't be given any air space from inside 30 feet so he could find cracks to
[17:14] exploit when defenses weren't set this should be a layup here because durant prioritizes curry but he
[17:21] also loses contact with staff and so it's a super efficient open three
[17:27] this is exactly why you'll see defenders run to the line with staff leaving the paint wide open for a ball
[17:34] handler you'll notice clay has a gravitational pull on defenders too
[17:39] and this made the two of them so difficult to guard as a tandem and particularly in screening actions
[17:47] where defenders are still accustomed to chasing thompson around screens and any brief lapse leaves one of the
[17:53] two best shooters ever uncovered here curry turns this cut
[17:59] into a screen his man keeps going to clay and the often stationary james harden
[18:04] is left sealed off and it's a layup when defense is wisen up to his back
[18:10] picks like this curry can then fake these screens slipping out to his personal atm
[18:16] for some more cash so then defenders remind themselves always stay with steph always stay with
[18:22] steph and that glues defenders to him well his teammates practice more layups
[18:28] he was also a nasty little screener because smaller players tend to get away with additional contact and movement
[18:35] as part of their natural grappling away from the action oh by the way curry could pass
[18:42] too while his teammates were usually piling up assists from his off-ball movement
[18:47] he could send it home himself for wide open layups too wide open some might say staff's
[18:55] combination of movement and ball handling meant he could flow from a cut to a
[19:01] drive to a kick out to feed his teammates and his release speed helped him turn an
[19:08] off the dribble threat into a quick delivery for two all of his super giant gravity in
[19:14] transition opened up passing lanes as well and it was the same story setting up for a deep
[19:20] pull-up three jazz are pulled into his orbit and it's high percentage offense
[19:26] at the hoop curry had good vision in general he's
[19:31] probing for a pull-up but snaps off a live dribble pass instead and he hit a bunch of these
[19:37] little creases in the middle of the floor in transition here's another quick trigger pass off
[19:44] the bounce this time he whips it left-handed although clay wasn't really in the mood for a layup apparently
[19:50] so it turns into a right-handed drive-in kick from curry kick-out passes were actually
[19:57] a bit of an adventure for him because of how small he was he couldn't throw it over the top so
[20:03] deflections were an issue and when he probed deeper size could swallow up his passing
[20:09] angles and clog his outlet valves when he kept his gerbil alive and had
[20:15] cleaner sight lines these turned into open threes but he could also dribble himself into a
[20:22] forest of trees where he couldn't really see the best pass the top of the key is wide open
[20:27] here and yet it's another deflection he could get into the paint and find
[20:33] laydown passes when help came over but accuracy could also be a problem on
[20:38] some of these deliveries some of steph's passing at the rim was a
[20:44] bit wild like this note this was a no no-look attempt and curry mixed in his fair share of
[20:50] lookaways to make up for that lack of passing height it also helped that he varied his
[20:56] deliveries mixing hook passes with bouncers and little two-handed drop-offs like this
[21:03] some of these were bold ideas this is a magic johnson heater past j.r smith's
[21:08] ear and this play shows reflexes and court awareness spinning to find a teammate in tight
[21:15] quarters however some bold ideas bordered on reckless
[21:20] throwing errant behind the back passes or just wavering into sloppiness on basic deliveries leading to more
[21:27] turnovers out of spread pick and roll he could deliver most passes
[21:32] this is a basic strong side help off the shooter a pass away and here's a skip pass where the weak
[21:39] side defender slides over to help and it's another draymond 3. it was actually rare for curry to get
[21:45] downhill with this classic two-on-one because he usually just took a three against coverages like this he could
[21:52] certainly hit the opposite side shooter but it was more common to see a
[21:57] second defender jump him while his teammates rolled to the basket this is a bit late
[22:03] because it was tricky throwing these around bigger defenders on this play the big man gives him space
[22:10] so it's a much easier completion before the paint help arrives compare
[22:15] that to this coverage where two huge defenders are involved one pressuring curry on the ball
[22:21] while durant sits in front of the roller and it's a different pass another thing that changes his pick and
[22:28] roll dynamic is where many of these screens are set curry's near the logo here
[22:33] and so it takes longer to hit screeners who aren't shooting threats when they roll
[22:38] this time it's staggered screens and again size makes it uncomfortable enough to bypass durant for a short roll pass
[22:46] but he uses the look away and throws it out of bounds so steph saw most valuable passes on
[22:54] screen and rolls it was often just a matter of finding a delivery angle so he could send it home
[23:01] again this meant using those whip passes and hook passes that he loved with both hands and
[23:07] he sprinkled in more audacious lobs or soft deliveries as well many teams
[23:13] simply trapped the curry pick and roll just to get the ball out of his hands and that could stall the offense a touch
[23:21] if hardin recovered on time here this wouldn't be an open kd jumper which is where draymond's short
[23:27] roll passing became so critical gashing teams in these four on threes
[23:33] green's ball handling high high-end vision and speed made him a phenomenal fit next to curry
[23:39] where he could pick apart defenses as a roll man when opposing teams tried to neuter steph's three-point shooting
[23:46] a great passing hub like draymond is an ideal partner for off-ball workhorses
[23:51] like curry he can capitalize on steph's gravity from the top make extra passes after curry is trapped
[23:59] or collapse the defense with the ball himself setting up arguably the greatest perimeter finisher ever
[24:06] this helped those warriors teams put together phenomenal regular season offenses
[24:12] and while they were still great in the playoffs they fell back a little commentary with curry's drop in scoring
[24:18] we saw earlier keep in mind though team sold out to take away his scoring
[24:25] so that huge off-ball effect made him a playmaking machine estimates of his shot
[24:31] creation land in the top 15 of all time and it's hard to say how well that even accounts
[24:36] for his unique ability to stretch defenses so there are lingering questions about his
[24:42] offensive impact in the playoffs but before we get to those we need to look at just how effective he
[24:48] was on the defensive end i might oh this is him yeah he's
[24:55] speaking to the mic i thought she was doing a ricky bobby thing like oh this is my mic i got you i'm feeling i'm feeling great but um
[25:01] i'm excited about the finals we got four wins to go so hopefully get it done while the warriors dynasty set a new
[25:08] standard for offensive excellence they were also a high-end defensive team
[25:14] as one of the best defenders of the 21st century draymond green led golden state's
[25:20] switchable intelligent scheme on that end and because the warriors surrounded curry
[25:26] with four players who were six foot six or taller most of the time it was common practice for teams to
[25:33] target steph in the playoffs the cavs did this in bursts during all of their final matchups
[25:40] looking for a switch onto the dangerous kyrie irving or the much larger lebron james who
[25:46] could use his size to back curry down into the post and force help or score himself
[25:53] in the 2018 western finals houston hunted curry even more since attacking weak spots
[25:59] with james harden or chris paul was a core part of their offense this strategy adds to curry's physical wear
[26:06] and tear potentially slowing down his attack and getting him into foul trouble
[26:13] but otherwise it wasn't enormously effective because curry held up pretty well against even the game's best
[26:19] isolation scorers kyrie gives up on this one with green finally shifted over
[26:25] and against hardin there were strong moments he jabs at the ball twice and disrupts him
[26:30] then crowds him and takes one in the ear for an offensive foul steph was pesky on the ball like this
[26:38] using his hands quite a bit the left hand slows down the driver the right hand then controls him a little
[26:44] and he was small enough to get away with this contact he was actually really physical in
[26:49] general on defense actively pawing at the ball and bodying up ball handlers with his
[26:55] hands high when they drove like this he didn't have incredible lateral
[27:00] quickness he goes to put some weight into irving here and turns into a matador trying to recover
[27:07] but he wasn't smoked off the dribble too frequently because of how active he was on the balls of his feet his willingness to get
[27:14] physical and his reaction time notice the really short steps which helps him stay balanced so he can
[27:21] quickly change directions with the ball handler you can see how sharp his reflexes are here
[27:27] sliding with harden's crossover immediately bodying him hard and then he smothers a
[27:33] shot at the end curry loved attacking the ball at the end of a move like this
[27:39] he's a bit behind on this one but ends up with a late strip and his hands were active on the outside
[27:46] as well preventing a step back attempt on this play steph was often trying to overcome a
[27:53] size disadvantage he wasn't going to throw off many shots vertically so attacking the rock
[27:59] low like this gave him a chance even if it led to some fouls in the process
[28:05] that hand-eye coordination helped him connect on plenty of these when he was balanced and had a clear
[28:11] look at the ball catching leather not once but twice in this sequence
[28:16] he's completely beaten here again grabs an arm to slow down the dribbler and the hands save the play from behind
[28:24] because he was only 6'2 curry was a mismatch for bigger players on the block
[28:30] on this one he tries to hold off lebron but james is too powerful and so it's a foul
[28:36] his counter measure for this was to front the post hard and deny an entry pass in the first
[28:41] place and because he had a high revving motor he was pretty successful with this technique
[28:47] here he sits down to take away the entry then works hard to track the ball at a different angle and comes up with a
[28:54] steal the warriors had other techniques to protect him pre-switching curry here so he wouldn't
[29:00] be involved in the pick and roll and then draymond sees a potential mismatch and breaks up the post pass beautifully
[29:07] steph could also get really physical with screeners which helped avoid a switch and kept
[29:12] everyone on their original assignment although crowding potential screeners and getting
[29:19] handsy with them opened up a few back door cuts and when steph overplayed off ball shooters like
[29:25] this he occasionally received a taste of his own medicine unsurprisingly he was also physically
[29:32] chasing players off the ball he could lean over his toes and get off balance like that
[29:37] and again here's some hand fighting and subtle holding to stay connected and then on the ball
[29:43] more of the usual jabbing at the rock and sliding to stay in front of the dribbler
[29:50] when guarding the ball handler he could power through some of these screens sometimes to stay with his man
[29:56] and even if that didn't work he was quite good about staying connected to the screener on a switch
[30:02] using his bag of tricks i'd say he was generally good navigating ball screens
[30:09] here steering the dribbler away from the screen by design then activating those hands on the roll
[30:14] pass for another steal on this one he steps up in front of the screen nicely to avoid it
[30:20] and that contains everything well although curry gambles for a steal and that exposes the warriors in the
[30:27] paint he actually rarely took overt gambles like that he was selective about selling out for
[30:34] these sneak attacks and his ability to play passing lanes was based more on anticipation and reflexes
[30:41] than on risk taking this again made him similar to bird their best defensive strength was
[30:47] reading these kinds of passes and timing up interceptions without taking needless chances this is a three on one and he
[30:55] spots the passer's eyes to make an incredible save off the lob and then going the other way turns it
[31:02] into two points himself steph was also dangerous sneaking around
[31:07] outlet passes like this and yeah that's probably going in and it is time to dance on the floor
[31:15] here's one off the inbounds and this time curry wants to bring clay into the party and that team was just unfair
[31:23] between his active hands and his ability to jump passes like this curry landed in the 93rd percentile
[31:29] historically in steals during these years he was also smart about timing up his double teams
[31:36] and what's key here is that he keeps going after the first effort saving a layup with the extra help and
[31:43] he rarely missed these second and third efforts on a defensive sequence flowing from one responsibility to the
[31:50] next that's a decent closeout to end the possession although i wouldn't say he was that
[31:56] effective closing out because his size made jumpers easier for shooters his small stature was a
[32:02] limiting factor on paint rotations too where he could slide into position but couldn't offer much resistance at
[32:09] the rim steph was generally on point when he needed to rotate into the lane like this
[32:14] and that's far better than being bigger but late to arrive or blowing the assignment
[32:20] here's a nice example where he's early to help on the pick and roll then gives extra effort to tag a cutter
[32:27] when the ball switches to the other side of the court but still he added basically zero rim
[32:33] protection on high leverage plays where he needed to plug up the back line and despite his consistent effort he had
[32:41] an occasional attentional lapse focusing in on the ball too much and falling a few steps out of position
[32:48] impact metrics actually view him as a solid positive defender although his overall playoff numbers are
[32:55] far more pedestrian than his incredible regular season stats but even if injuries weren't the reason
[33:02] why his missed time still skewed these impact numbers his teammates were able to inflate their
[33:09] plus minus by playing weaker teams in early rounds but steph's plus minus was accrued
[33:15] against championship level opponents in the later rounds if we calculated the
[33:21] numbers after curry returned from his injuries giving his teammates the same opponents as him
[33:27] suddenly steph looks like one of the most impactful playoff performers on record
[33:32] even with a clear drop in 2016 compared to his surrounding seasons
[33:38] and at least to me that's a compelling signal that the extra defensive attention he
[33:44] received still shredded defenses even if his scoring dipped as a result
[33:50] furthermore in larger regular season samples his numbers were still incredibly
[33:55] impressive against strong defenses when compared to weak ones maintaining most of his volume and
[34:02] efficiency relative to other great players there's also some evidence that he'll
[34:07] ramp up his scoring more when he shares the floor with weaker finishers his volume with durant and thompson on
[34:15] the bench resembles video game levels and these numbers are similar in a much larger regular season sample
[34:23] throughout all of these permutations golden state's efficiency with curry on the court
[34:28] remained elite while they crushed their opponents i do still have some concerns about his
[34:35] durability attacking him on defense and wearing down his legs seemed to have some effect but curry's gravity is a
[34:42] constant phenomenon that made him arguably the most scalable offensive weapon in basketball history
[34:50] making life easier for basically any other offensive star he doesn't have the
[34:56] typical signs of an impact defender but he also doesn't look like a negative on that end either
[35:03] instead his incredible value comes almost entirely from his otherworldly shooting
[35:08] off-ball impact and that on-ball play-making which is a one-of-a-kind package that
[35:14] combined to make steph curry perhaps the best offensive
[35:20] player in nba history

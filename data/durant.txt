[00:00] at the slender age of 21 kevin durant
[00:03] finished second in mvp voting
[00:05] on a league best 30 points per game
[00:08] over the years he improved his ball
[00:10] handling playmaking and defense
[00:13] winning the mvp in 2014. but
[00:16] just how good was he in those areas
[00:19] should he have been an all-league
[00:21] defender and was his combination of
[00:24] size agility and world-class
[00:27] outside shooting enough to make him the
[00:29] greatest scorer
[00:31] of all time you are watching
[00:34] what greatness is all about where's
[00:37] larry bird in all this
[00:38] has it walked by elijah michael jordan
[00:42] saves the
[00:44] this series tackles one question who was
[00:46] the best
[00:47] at his best we start at the aba merger
[00:50] and go through the best
[00:51] multi-year stretches examining the
[00:53] legends who provided the most
[00:55] on-court impact these are the greatest
[00:59] peaks
[01:05] kd what is it that you do better than
[01:08] anybody
[01:10] and you don't have to be humble here
[01:11] we're just not just a small
[01:13] group of friends and people with cameras
[01:16] honestly i think i scored better than
[01:18] anybody in oklahoma city
[01:20] durant was a scoring animal claiming
[01:23] four scoring titles in five seasons
[01:27] the slim reaper was just the fourth
[01:28] player in league history
[01:30] with a dominant scoring stretch like
[01:32] that joining wilt chamberlain
[01:34] michael jordan and the one and only ice
[01:37] man
[01:37] you figured it out yet no not that ice
[01:40] man
[01:40] but george girvin a six foot seven point
[01:43] machine
[01:44] who was all arms and legs too girvin had
[01:47] a soft sweet stroke
[01:49] lived in the mid-range in that era and
[01:52] of course he could finger roll
[01:54] he was also so long he could just shoot
[01:56] right over defenders
[01:58] which made him a pre-three-point era
[02:01] prototype
[02:02] for duran kd was an upgrade in just
[02:05] about every area
[02:07] he was even bigger standing six nine and
[02:09] a half without shoes
[02:11] and like ice he could work off screens
[02:13] and find little sweet spots to detonate
[02:16] from
[02:16] but durant could also launch from behind
[02:19] the arc
[02:20] and 39 3-point shooting during these
[02:22] seasons
[02:23] juiced his scoring efficiency you'll
[02:26] notice how many of these shots involve
[02:28] movement because sliding around to find
[02:30] scoring pockets
[02:31] and then catching and shooting was a
[02:33] huge part of durant's success
[02:36] 59 percent of his outside shots were
[02:38] assisted
[02:39] around average among high-volume
[02:41] long-range shooters
[02:44] he wasn't a jitterbug without the ball
[02:46] but he could throw off some defenders
[02:48] flipping this cut back around the screen
[02:50] beautifully
[02:52] and because he was a super-sized wing
[02:54] with a 7-5
[02:55] wingspan he could drop these right over
[02:58] strong contests from
[02:59] big men yet he had enough agility in him
[03:02] to backdoor
[03:04] this action when he felt an overplay and
[03:06] this takes nice
[03:07] feel to read a defender and his size
[03:10] made these lobs easy to finish
[03:12] because he was such a large target
[03:14] guards could throw over the top to him
[03:16] like this
[03:17] and he was slithery enough to catch off
[03:19] a screen
[03:20] and attack all the way to the cup so in
[03:23] addition to great shooting from the
[03:25] mid-range
[03:25] and deep kd could put it on the deck and
[03:29] finish in traffic with those
[03:30] praying mantis arms this dribble drive
[03:34] game was a huge part of his scoring
[03:36] prowess
[03:37] because if teams tried to run him off
[03:39] the line he was
[03:40] one dribble from a layup with the size
[03:42] to finish
[03:44] kevin could initiate these attacks
[03:46] flying into a big man and finishing
[03:48] nicely here
[03:49] but if that big man sagged off in the
[03:51] pick and roll he could burn them with
[03:53] his
[03:53] pull-up three this put defenses in a
[03:57] serious pickle
[03:58] because he had the range precision of a
[04:00] modern guard
[04:01] but if they overreacted to his shooting
[04:03] he could blow by and finish among the
[04:05] trees at the rim
[04:07] his ball handling and a little bit of
[04:10] shiftiness
[04:11] boosted this penetration game but he
[04:13] also had some burst in his engines
[04:15] covering a ton of ground in just a
[04:18] dribble or two
[04:19] it looks like he's preparing to use this
[04:22] screen
[04:22] this defender is worried about a pull up
[04:24] 3 so he crosses back over and
[04:26] accelerates downhill for free throws
[04:29] by the way putting kd on the line was a
[04:32] bad idea
[04:33] since he shot a little under 90 percent
[04:35] in those years
[04:36] and he was able to get there with some
[04:38] regularity thanks to tricks like the rip
[04:41] through move
[04:42] he also would drive into some contact
[04:46] there's a huge crossover and he just
[04:48] plows into the help for the
[04:49] plus one but durant's rim finishing was
[04:52] more about his
[04:53] speed and long strides than strength or
[04:57] physicality
[04:58] he builds up a head of steam here picks
[05:00] up his dribble at the free throw line
[05:02] and sidesteps to create a little opening
[05:04] and he's so long it's a drop in the
[05:06] bucket
[05:07] that's usually some smothered chicken by
[05:09] tim duncan
[05:10] against a smaller player durant used
[05:14] these
[05:14] euro-like steps to slip past defenders
[05:17] in space
[05:18] and here kawhi leonard runs him off the
[05:20] line durant wisely attacks his front leg
[05:23] and then look at all the ground he
[05:25] covers with a single stride
[05:28] big men were often worried about
[05:29] durant's pull-up
[05:31] it was a larger part of his attack than
[05:33] getting all the way to the hoop
[05:34] so he could use a little hesitation to
[05:36] freeze them and then gallop home with
[05:38] those long
[05:39] legs he didn't get to the basket as
[05:42] often as someone like lebron did
[05:44] but when he did durant was extremely
[05:47] efficient
[05:48] finishing with the 14th best field goal
[05:50] percentage at the rim since 2001.
[05:54] like lebron kd was a weapon in
[05:57] transition
[05:58] sometimes he'd turn up the speed and
[06:00] pressure backpedaling opponents
[06:01] and he could also run to the three-point
[06:03] line and drop daggers from there as
[06:06] a finisher these skills work together
[06:09] this defender jumps to the three-point
[06:11] line but durant just
[06:12] floors it for the flush and the
[06:15] interplay between
[06:16] long-range shooting and hard drives like
[06:19] this
[06:19] made him an elite transition scorer
[06:21] during these seasons
[06:24] he also liked to walk into threes in
[06:26] semi-transition
[06:27] there's that range again and between his
[06:30] long arms and a little elevation
[06:32] his release point on these was nearly
[06:34] unblockable
[06:36] little hops and hesitation moves force
[06:39] defenders to worry about his drive
[06:41] and that creates enough airspace to
[06:43] stroke these pull-ups
[06:45] over the outstretched arms of the
[06:46] longest defenders in the game
[06:49] even more so than girvin before him
[06:52] durant's ability to just
[06:54] rise up over players and rain jumpers on
[06:56] their head
[06:57] gave him access to mid-range shots
[07:00] almost
[07:00] on demand of course this is the least
[07:03] efficient of his scoring zones
[07:05] but by 2016 he improved his mid-range
[07:08] accuracy
[07:09] to about 49 a jump of over four
[07:12] percentage points
[07:14] from his earlier seasons when he won mvp
[07:17] and enough to regularly land him
[07:19] at or near the top of the league from
[07:21] this distance
[07:23] however as a three-point shooter kd was
[07:26] far
[07:27] more accurate in catch-and-shoot
[07:29] situations
[07:30] than off of these pull-ups from 2014 to
[07:33] 18
[07:34] he was a scorching 43 on catch and shoot
[07:37] attempts
[07:37] according to second spectrum's optical
[07:39] tracking but he was just
[07:41] under 35 on his pull-ups so
[07:45] he wasn't quite as lethal on these
[07:46] self-generated attempts
[07:49] he could certainly generate shots with
[07:51] his back to the basket
[07:53] again using his size to just rise up
[07:55] over defenders
[07:56] while comfortably working out of the mid
[07:58] post area to find little fade aways or
[08:01] turn arounds like this
[08:03] his post game included a mini dirk
[08:06] nowitzki impression
[08:07] occasionally flashing that ridiculous
[08:09] one-legged fall away
[08:10] like the big german himself
[08:14] durant's height allowed him to take
[08:16] smaller players to the block
[08:18] undersized guards like this offered
[08:20] little resistance that close to the hoop
[08:23] but stick bigger forwards on him and he
[08:25] could torture them by running around
[08:27] screens
[08:28] bigger players aren't used to chasing
[08:30] world class outside shooters
[08:32] and kevin was most comfortable catching
[08:34] and shooting without a dribble like this
[08:38] tarantula's ability to score at three
[08:40] levels
[08:41] both on and off the ball made him
[08:43] arguably the greatest
[08:45] regular season scorer we've ever seen
[08:48] in the playoffs however his
[08:50] effectiveness fell back to earth just a
[08:52] bit
[08:53] which still made him one of the great
[08:55] scorers in league history
[08:57] like all players his statistics were
[09:00] influenced by his
[09:01] teammates and his opponents without a
[09:03] teammate to break down defenses
[09:05] and set him up for easier looks durant's
[09:08] numbers as the lone
[09:09] offensive focal point look quite
[09:11] different than when he plays next to
[09:13] another star
[09:15] from 2014 to 18 with russell westbrook
[09:19] or steph curry on the court next to him
[09:21] kd's scoring efficiency looks
[09:23] really good compared to other high
[09:25] volume scores
[09:26] but without those star guards occupying
[09:29] defensive attention
[09:30] he took a sizable dip in efficiency
[09:33] because he had to create
[09:34] more of his own offense there was a
[09:37] significant
[09:37] increase in his unassisted field goals
[09:40] in those situations
[09:42] now thinking basketball regulars know
[09:45] that carrying an offense as a
[09:47] lone star isn't the be-all end-all
[09:50] there's arguably more value in creating
[09:52] scoring
[09:53] next to other high-end talent still
[09:56] both roles are relevant especially since
[09:59] so much of kevin durant's impact
[10:01] is rooted in his scoring game and
[10:05] the opportunities that scoring game
[10:07] helped him create
[10:09] for his teammates
[10:14] another vicious dunking last night
[10:16] here's what we know
[10:18] suspect is six nine wiry short hair nice
[10:21] smile
[10:21] why are we in 2016 the thunder took a 73
[10:26] win warriors team
[10:27] to the brink before new york city
[10:29] tourist clay thompson
[10:31] went into nba jam mode in game six
[10:34] and helped golden state survive in a
[10:36] classic seven
[10:37] game series that was one of durant's
[10:41] bumpier series during his prime
[10:43] largely because the warriors overloaded
[10:45] his side while ignoring his weaker
[10:47] shooting teammates
[10:49] sliding an extra defender smack into
[10:52] kd's driving lane
[10:53] allowed for greater ball pressure and
[10:56] pushed him into
[10:57] difficult contested jumpers this made it
[11:00] harder to attack the rim
[11:01] and a decent decline in shooting
[11:03] percentages at the hoop
[11:05] was one reason why durant's playoff
[11:07] scoring lagged behind his regular season
[11:09] output
[11:11] with both outside defenders hugged in
[11:13] and up
[11:14] into durant's driving gaps clay plays
[11:17] him tightly
[11:18] and durant fumbles it which kills a ton
[11:20] of clock and leads to a desperate
[11:22] attempt
[11:23] andre roberson's open because he's a 28
[11:26] shooter from the corner when kd
[11:29] played in golden state defenses couldn't
[11:32] pack the pain on him
[11:33] because of the splash brothers threat to
[11:35] shoot so scoring became
[11:37] easier for him there's an entire video
[11:39] on this channel about these extreme
[11:41] differences
[11:42] if you're interested for instance the
[11:45] warriors just
[11:45] ignore sergey baka on this play to drop
[11:48] a defender into the lane
[11:50] and that leads to a ball handling
[11:52] turnover from kevin
[11:54] despite some of these slick crossovers
[11:56] that helped him penetrate or pull up
[11:58] he had his share of fumbles and flubs as
[12:01] such a tall
[12:02] ball handler dribbling through a sea of
[12:05] defenders
[12:06] might work for leo messi but in
[12:08] basketball passing is the natural
[12:11] counter we've seen this from other
[12:13] modern wings in this series
[12:15] where soft doubles are attacked with
[12:17] timely and accurate skip
[12:19] passes durant could throw these passes
[12:22] at this point in his career although it
[12:24] could take him a beat to
[12:25] recognize one of these this is a bit of
[12:28] a floater
[12:28] which makes the first close out easier
[12:30] but still leads to a good shot
[12:33] again notice he gathers himself first
[12:35] but then flicks a quick pass the kind
[12:38] that makes it harder to close out to
[12:40] and it ends up in a three ball in the
[12:41] corner pocket
[12:43] kd did have some diversity on his
[12:46] releases
[12:46] and passing off the bounce with his
[12:48] right hand like that
[12:50] exploited gaps defenders can't
[12:52] anticipate the pass
[12:53] making slingshots like this much harder
[12:56] to react to
[12:58] here's a great delivery out of pick and
[13:00] roll blending a
[13:02] dribble into a skip pass and again
[13:04] throwing early
[13:05] provides more time for any shooter who
[13:08] was good enough to close out to
[13:10] and durant's handle and some passing
[13:13] flexibility
[13:14] let him play make out of these pick and
[13:16] roll actions
[13:18] remember defenses still had to focus on
[13:20] him as a pull-up
[13:21] weapon off of screens and he could use
[13:24] that threat to find
[13:25] pass increases here going to the
[13:27] hesitation
[13:28] and then passing after freezing the
[13:30] defender
[13:32] and he could make little pocket passes
[13:34] like this too with his rolling big men
[13:36] although this particular pass was
[13:38] actually a thorn in his side
[13:40] leading to plenty of batted balls and
[13:43] turnovers
[13:44] these passes can't just be mindlessly
[13:46] flicked into empty
[13:48] space and kd had lackadaisical moments
[13:51] as a distributor
[13:52] throwing deliberate or even telegraphed
[13:55] passes
[13:56] here's one where he fires it off a leg
[13:58] initially but on the recovery comes back
[14:01] to it with a little
[14:02] drop off and these were some of his
[14:04] better passes
[14:05] able to punish helping defenders when he
[14:08] got downhill
[14:10] i like that he threw some of these
[14:11] laydowns early that's a pretty quick
[14:14] reaction to nearly set up a dunk
[14:16] and it requires solid vision to identify
[14:19] openings like this
[14:20] as they begin to emerge he's still not
[14:23] someone i'd call a
[14:24] natural playmaker though he was thinking
[14:28] score first here instinctively dribbling
[14:30] before spotting the wide open layup
[14:33] this meant he wasn't a really strong off
[14:35] ball passer
[14:36] in part because he was looking to catch
[14:38] and score on these
[14:40] he could make this pass off a curl but
[14:42] it wasn't a consistent
[14:44] find for him on this one he just misses
[14:48] a wide open look
[14:49] under the rim and this looks like one of
[14:51] those problematic ball handling
[14:53] situations
[14:54] where he wasn't smooth picking up his
[14:56] dribble
[14:58] this one's a more basic pick and roll
[15:00] attack right-handed dribble
[15:02] into tons of space under control
[15:05] and he gets below the free throw line
[15:07] for a gorgeous little drop off
[15:10] however he didn't always take that extra
[15:13] dribble
[15:14] that's a nice little pocket pass but if
[15:16] kd attacks the gap
[15:18] it gets his roll man a step deeper and
[15:21] potentially opens up the corner pass
[15:23] we saw lebron james regularly take that
[15:26] dribble last episode
[15:27] whereas durant was often quick to pick
[15:29] it up near traffic
[15:31] or not always attack these gaps this is
[15:34] a two on one with the roll man
[15:36] but even though the defender starts
[15:38] retreating he pulls up for a tricky
[15:40] jumper
[15:41] instead of applying more pressure
[15:44] in transition he didn't need to get deep
[15:47] into the paint
[15:48] because his speed and pull-up shooting
[15:50] provided enough pressure to draw extra
[15:52] defensive attention
[15:55] and when he did push having his head up
[15:57] and more space
[15:58] made these more comfortable hookups for
[16:01] him
[16:02] speaking of transition he played with a
[16:04] one-man fast break
[16:06] in westbrook who carved up defenses
[16:09] himself with violent bursts of speed
[16:12] that thunder team was really a two-man
[16:15] operation
[16:16] with role players flanking them in
[16:18] support and westbrook had some chemistry
[16:20] setting up durant as part of his
[16:22] off-ball game
[16:24] katie couldn't create for his teammates
[16:26] like westbrook
[16:27] but estimates of his shock creation land
[16:29] him at about
[16:30] 85 of kobe bryant's peak from episode 10
[16:34] making him a grade a offensive
[16:36] centerpiece
[16:38] durant might not have been ideal in a
[16:40] heliocentric role
[16:42] as a lone offensive creator but his
[16:45] off-ball game added tons of value
[16:47] next to other competent playmakers kd
[16:51] could space the floor for his teammates
[16:53] especially as a power forward and his
[16:56] shooting provided some gravity
[16:58] that made things easier for other
[17:00] players on offense
[17:02] this is a highly scalable attack able to
[17:05] plug in next to other superstars without
[17:08] the ball
[17:09] and add value as a secondary playmaker
[17:14] between his elite scoring off-ball
[17:16] shooting
[17:17] and solid ability to create for others
[17:20] durant's been part of some seriously
[17:22] high-end offenses
[17:23] first in okc in spite of some of their
[17:26] spacing issues
[17:28] and then as a key piece in golden state
[17:30] where he joined an incredible attack and
[17:32] made them even better
[17:35] on defense durant's versatility played
[17:38] right into the warriors switching scheme
[17:41] this allowed them to play the vaunted
[17:43] hamptons 5 lineup
[17:45] with katie adding an element of rim
[17:47] protection to a smaller group
[17:50] that expansive 7 foot 5 wingspan
[17:53] gave him some rim protecting chops and
[17:56] as a small forward
[17:57] he was a high-end shot blocker take this
[18:01] play
[18:01] where he's actually late to rotate and
[18:03] help but once he arrives he can defend a
[18:06] big
[18:06] right at the rim so as a wing on the
[18:09] court
[18:10] he was an additional paint defender who
[18:12] could challenge high value shots like
[18:14] this
[18:15] and when he played the 4 he was still
[18:18] able to plug up the back line
[18:20] with all that length and of course he
[18:22] could switch multiple positions
[18:25] he starts out guarding draymond green
[18:27] but picks up clay out of this scrum
[18:30] and then slides up and defends the goal
[18:31] with those pterodactyl wings
[18:34] here's a clutch play where golden state
[18:36] switched to ball screen
[18:38] because good luck attacking draymond
[18:40] green so that leaves thompson
[18:42] on a bigger skilled post player and with
[18:44] draymond on the perimeter
[18:46] durant can still come over and defend it
[18:49] this kind of length and versatility is
[18:52] perfect for these spaced out switching
[18:55] defenses that became more popular during
[18:57] these seasons
[18:59] now despite durant's size he wasn't a
[19:02] defensive big man by
[19:03] nature and that meant he wasn't that
[19:06] physical down low
[19:08] and didn't take up space in traffic or
[19:10] throw his body onto powerful players
[19:13] he also wasn't comfortable planting
[19:15] himself in driving lanes and playing
[19:17] goalkeeper
[19:18] and would often contest shots from
[19:20] deeper under the basket
[19:22] he didn't have the best timing as a shot
[19:24] blocker he jumps way before
[19:26] the shooter here and it's a foul this
[19:29] held him back a little bit
[19:31] as a shot blocker but the more important
[19:33] issue was not always being in position
[19:35] to defend some of these shots
[19:38] kevin could be a bit spacey at times
[19:41] you see him check the corner then stare
[19:44] right at this cut as it unfolds
[19:46] yet he doesn't react until the ball
[19:48] almost arrives
[19:49] if he moved earlier he's not going to be
[19:51] buried under the rim
[19:53] or there might not be a pass at all some
[19:56] of these plays were classic
[19:57] cases of ball watching while a cutter
[20:00] flew by
[20:01] and he could have momentary lapses
[20:03] assuming this was going to be a handoff
[20:06] and there's that mis-timed jump on the
[20:08] recovery
[20:09] vision could also be an issue too there
[20:12] were moments where he struggled to
[20:13] locate the basketball
[20:15] and i'm not sure he knew a pass was made
[20:17] when he was called to switch onto the
[20:19] shooter
[20:20] chasing players off ball like this
[20:23] occupied some of those limited
[20:24] attentional resources
[20:26] and his size made navigating screens a
[20:28] bit tricky
[20:29] especially in an era where offensive
[20:31] linemen i mean
[20:32] screeners can move pretty liberally
[20:37] on this one he's preparing for one
[20:39] screen but it's reversed and without
[20:41] tight cornering skills
[20:42] durant takes a wide path back to the
[20:44] shooter so it's a clean look
[20:47] when he was guarding the dribbler
[20:49] directly he could still get hung up on
[20:51] ball screens like this
[20:52] but he could also fight through some of
[20:55] these screens
[20:55] battling the pick while keeping ball
[20:58] handlers within that giant
[20:59] reach of his switching schemes were
[21:02] ideal for kd
[21:04] precisely because he had some success
[21:06] against a variety of players
[21:08] on the perimeter the emphasis here is on
[21:11] some because he could author really
[21:13] effective possessions against
[21:15] elite wing players when all of his
[21:17] lateral movements synced up with the
[21:19] ball handler
[21:20] or when he didn't have to react to
[21:22] sudden stop and go moves
[21:24] and then that length could work wonders
[21:28] against shiftier opponents he was
[21:30] vulnerable to sudden changes in
[21:32] direction
[21:33] it's a lot for him to snap his hips
[21:35] around to track curry here
[21:36] and in general he didn't have great
[21:38] acceleration from a standstill
[21:40] when he was in a defensive stance like
[21:42] this compare that to a more straight
[21:45] line attack with
[21:46] kd swiveling his hips at an angle to
[21:49] stay with the drive
[21:50] and that's a nice defensive stand here's
[21:53] another one against a curry pull back
[21:55] and because durant can decelerate well
[21:58] his length just
[21:59] eats this up good post scorers with some
[22:02] muscle
[22:03] could find success against him near the
[22:05] bucket but he was rarely a mismatch when
[22:08] checking bigs down on the block
[22:10] since he was often just as tall as them
[22:13] and his capacity to mix perimeter
[22:15] responsibilities
[22:16] with big man responsibilities like
[22:19] rotating back to the paint
[22:20] after guarding a pick and roll is a nice
[22:23] value add in any flexible switching
[22:26] scheme the kind that tends to have more
[22:28] value
[22:29] throughout the gauntlet of the post
[22:31] season
[22:32] his impact metrics on defense are a bit
[22:35] up and down
[22:36] but on average they see him as a small
[22:38] positive and i think
[22:40] that's in the right ballpark which puts
[22:42] his overall numbers in the vicinity of
[22:45] some of the other greats in this series
[22:47] his numbers were actually better in
[22:49] golden state
[22:51] swapping in his injured 2019 playoffs
[22:54] in place of his final run in okc where
[22:57] he was dragged down by some poor
[22:59] shooting some of that shooting might
[23:01] have been bad
[23:02] luck but some of it was being a primary
[23:05] focal point
[23:06] that defenses could load up on in golden
[23:09] state he was able to blend his on-ball
[23:11] scoring
[23:12] with his considerable off-ball talents
[23:14] in a more
[23:15] ideal hybridized role that didn't strain
[23:19] his self-generated scoring
[23:21] or ask too much of his playmaking this
[23:24] hybrid package
[23:25] helped him generate impressive offenses
[23:28] next to a ball dominant player like
[23:30] russell westbrook
[23:31] and then turn a great offense into the
[23:34] best one
[23:34] ever in golden state so while he wasn't
[23:38] a
[23:38] classic offensive quarterback his
[23:41] incredible shooting
[23:43] and overall scoring package along with
[23:45] his versatile
[23:47] positive defense combined to give kevin
[23:50] durant
[23:51] one of the greatest peaks in nba history

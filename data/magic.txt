[00:00] earvin magic johnson
[00:03] the star of showtime a highlight reel
[00:07] legend who won
[00:08] five championships in los angeles but
[00:11] was there more to his game than just
[00:13] fancy passing
[00:15] what was his defensive impact like and
[00:18] could someone who wasn't a huge scorer
[00:21] actually be the greatest offensive
[00:23] player
[00:24] in nba
[00:29] what history is all about where's larry
[00:32] bird in all this
[00:34] has it blocked by elijah michael jordan
[00:37] saves the day
[00:39] this series tackles one question who was
[00:42] the best
[00:42] at his best we start at the aba merger
[00:45] and go through the best
[00:46] multi-year stretches examining the
[00:48] legends who provided the most
[00:50] on-court impact these are the greatest
[00:56] peaks
[01:01] magic's just a great basketball player
[01:02] he's the best i've ever seen
[01:04] you know i
[01:08] unbelievable i don't know what to say in
[01:11] the early days of the nba
[01:12] ball handling was left to the shorter
[01:14] players point guards maxed out at about
[01:17] six foot
[01:17] five until young magic johnson shattered
[01:20] that ceiling
[01:21] at six eight magic had the size of a big
[01:24] man but instead he became the tallest
[01:26] floor general in league history
[01:28] irvin always possessed these high-level
[01:31] ball skills
[01:32] playing this way in high school and
[01:34] college and his ability to handle the
[01:36] ball
[01:36] at high speed made him a unicorn in
[01:39] transition
[01:40] with everyone within 20 feet of the hoop
[01:42] then rebounds turned into foot races and
[01:46] magic speed strained backpedaling
[01:48] defenders
[01:49] that little change of direction is
[01:50] enough to spin around the defense
[01:52] and there are no bigs back to stop the
[01:54] oversized johnson
[01:56] with everyone chasing offensive rebounds
[01:58] magic could often charge the rim
[02:00] as the largest player and he loved that
[02:03] in and out dribble
[02:04] but also notice his change of direction
[02:06] at speed
[02:07] the big step one way then striding the
[02:09] other
[02:10] he wasn't quite a euro stepper in these
[02:13] spots
[02:14] but his use of elongated strides for his
[02:16] height
[02:17] was part of his downhill devastation
[02:19] even against set defenders
[02:22] that's a baby cut there to dust the
[02:23] first offender a beautiful behind the
[02:25] back dribble
[02:26] and then almost a proto-euro step with a
[02:29] big step right then changing directions
[02:31] back to the left
[02:33] he wasn't giannis but magic's size and
[02:36] head of speed
[02:37] made it difficult to keep him from
[02:38] getting to the cup and so he became the
[02:41] godfather of the grab and go
[02:43] scooping a rebound and flooring it to
[02:45] the other end
[02:47] even on makes he would build speed and
[02:49] drive it down your throat
[02:51] danny ainge stays with the crossover
[02:53] here but boston's center isn't back yet
[02:55] so magic can easily clean up the miss
[02:58] off this make he builds up speed and
[03:01] seattle's center is near the three-point
[03:03] line so that change of direction turns
[03:05] him around and look at how low
[03:06] and sturdy johnson is he's powering
[03:08] through contact with his body
[03:10] and it's free throws here come the
[03:13] lakers again off a make
[03:14] only this time boston has pieces in
[03:17] place but magic
[03:18] up shifts into a backpedaling age and so
[03:21] help defenders need to sink into the
[03:22] lane
[03:23] and that just creates wide open offense
[03:26] defenses who flooded the paint in
[03:28] transition to wall off magic
[03:30] still surrendered perimeter jumpers
[03:33] these outside jumpers were big wins for
[03:35] defenses
[03:36] especially long twos but magic pressure
[03:38] created a kind of
[03:40] pick your poison where if help came he
[03:42] smoked it with his passing
[03:45] jack approves so that made big men
[03:48] reluctant to leave their marks
[03:50] and then magic just scored over smaller
[03:53] defenders
[03:54] his playmaking was so threatening he
[03:56] could use it to unlock
[03:58] scoring imagine playing defense against
[04:00] this
[04:01] if you sprint back magic uses that body
[04:04] to cut you off and slow you down
[04:06] and if you're a big man hustling back
[04:07] you have to snap yourself around only to
[04:09] cover ac
[04:10] green flying down the wing but joke's on
[04:12] you because the magician still has the
[04:14] ball
[04:16] of course magic's threat to score also
[04:18] opened passing windows in turn
[04:20] and this is all possible because of his
[04:22] dribbling behind the back
[04:24] through the legs whatever it took magic
[04:27] was
[04:27] incredibly secure with his handle in
[04:29] tight spots changing speeds when needed
[04:32] shielding the ball with his body and
[04:34] snapping passes off the bounce
[04:36] this allowed him to probe defenses he's
[04:39] cut off well here
[04:40] but protects the ball from a trailer and
[04:41] then attacks with the left and again the
[04:43] body protects the rock
[04:46] he made it look easy but at 6 8 magic's
[04:49] ability to protect the ball
[04:50] at speed he was rarely ever stripped and
[04:53] used his body to shield defenders
[04:55] made him arguably the most dominant
[04:57] transition weapon ever
[05:00] it was largely the same story in the
[05:02] half court ii this guard tries to funnel
[05:05] magic
[05:05] into this big man but he ends up bodying
[05:07] him out of the play and it's free throws
[05:10] irvin also used that tight handle and
[05:12] change of speed
[05:13] this stop and go turn jon stockton into
[05:16] a matador
[05:17] and magic's acceleration could blow by
[05:19] athletic wings
[05:22] he could also score from floater range
[05:24] flowing into shots at all kinds of
[05:26] angles with crafty little releases like
[05:28] this
[05:29] fist pump when headed right to left he
[05:31] also had a
[05:32] rolling hook shot from this range and he
[05:34] could feel contact and immediately hop
[05:37] into a soft shot attempt his size and
[05:40] body control
[05:41] made these looks clean and magic's
[05:44] incredible dexterity led to some
[05:45] seriously soft touch on these shots
[05:49] he also used his size to pick apart
[05:51] defenses from the perimeter
[05:52] hurling assists over the top and the
[05:55] accuracy and
[05:56] speed on some of these deliveries set
[05:58] them apart
[05:59] again he's using his body here able to
[06:02] shield off defenders by
[06:04] turning his back while still seeing all
[06:06] the action
[06:07] and his height let him keep a live
[06:09] dribble while just diming up teammates
[06:11] over shorter guards
[06:13] and these were some of the most
[06:14] brilliant passes ever does anyone look
[06:17] open here because magic slingshots a
[06:20] pass
[06:20] over traffic to worthy all because this
[06:23] defender turned away from james to
[06:24] navigate the screen
[06:26] worthy stopped instead of going through
[06:28] and magic's third eye read the whole
[06:30] thing
[06:31] johnson fired bold passes like this
[06:34] across the paint regularly
[06:36] and they required velocity and the
[06:38] acuity to read defender's eyes so he
[06:40] could throw fastballs
[06:41] right by their heads and they couldn't
[06:43] react in time
[06:44] bonus points for trying this against
[06:46] larry bird who already picked off a
[06:48] tight magic pass earlier in that game
[06:51] that one was a looping attempt and magic
[06:54] clearly trusted his fastball more
[06:56] sometimes even too much overestimating
[06:58] how quickly he could teleport one
[07:00] past a nearby defender
[07:03] and there are spots where a lob or
[07:06] something softer over the top
[07:08] look open but he often throws it harder
[07:12] here he needs to lob one out in front of
[07:14] his intended receiver but misses it and
[07:16] then he's called for a
[07:17] one-step travel changing his mind
[07:20] another minor nitpick about magic's
[07:22] fastball is that sometimes it was a
[07:24] little too hot to handle
[07:26] but most of the time his passing
[07:28] velocity fit the ball
[07:30] into tight windows for instance some of
[07:32] his entries from the top like this were
[07:33] just
[07:34] bull's-eyes he wasn't quite at bird's
[07:37] level as an outlet passer
[07:39] but he was splendid there as well able
[07:42] to use that hairpin trigger off the
[07:43] bounce from the back
[07:44] court and magic's best outlets were
[07:47] snapping completions to his streaking
[07:49] teammates like this there is an argument
[07:53] that bird was a better pure
[07:54] passer of sorts but i'm comfortable
[07:56] saying he was a superior
[07:58] off-ball passer where magic's dribbling
[08:00] gave him a huge on-ball
[08:02] edge johnson carved out way more chances
[08:06] and risk-taking in those spots is a
[08:08] natural trade-off
[08:10] he also mastered certain angles and
[08:11] reads and relentlessly hit them over and
[08:14] over
[08:14] and so it's nearly impossible to argue
[08:16] that anyone created more offense for his
[08:18] teammates
[08:19] in the 60s 70s or 80s than peak magic
[08:22] johnson
[08:23] using our best estimates of shots
[08:25] created no one
[08:26] forced help and then set up a teammate
[08:28] more than magic until the 2000s
[08:30] and even if we include everyone from the
[08:32] three-point era
[08:33] johnson still looks historically strong
[08:35] as a playmaker
[08:36] in these estimates so just how high did
[08:40] all of this playmaking
[08:42] take the lakers on offense and did magic
[08:44] give back any of that value
[08:46] because of questionable defense
[08:52] the converse weapon that's the shoot
[08:54] that's magic do what he was born to do
[08:56] toward the end of the 80s more of magic
[08:59] shock creation came in the half court
[09:01] as the lakers moved away from a steady
[09:03] diet of cream abdul-jabbar post-ups
[09:05] and started running more pick and roll
[09:07] for magic
[09:08] these were mostly side pick and rolls
[09:10] inside the line
[09:11] where defenses committed extra defenders
[09:14] and magic could spray passes for open
[09:16] looks this two-man game gave defenses
[09:20] fits where if they didn't send extra
[09:21] defenders magic could slice into the
[09:23] openings himself
[09:25] but of course his passing punished any
[09:27] help the defense collapses
[09:29] and this was before that little lob pass
[09:31] was popular
[09:33] off pick and roll magic could use all
[09:35] his little scoring tricks headed to the
[09:37] rim
[09:38] he could put that speedy hook pass to
[09:40] good use hitting the roll man
[09:43] and it wasn't as common but he could
[09:44] make the pocket pass too
[09:48] but perhaps the most critical part of
[09:50] this half-court dance
[09:51] was magic's outside shooting where he'd
[09:54] punish defenders who went under the
[09:56] screen
[09:57] he didn't pull this as frequently as
[09:59] some players do today
[10:00] but there were times when he was quick
[10:02] to fire and he was an underrated outside
[10:05] shooter in the last three years of his
[10:07] career he shot
[10:08] 90 percent at the foul line and he
[10:10] extended his range beyond the
[10:12] three-point strike
[10:13] hitting 34 percent of those before the
[10:16] 87 season
[10:18] magic said he had to shift his mindset
[10:20] to become more of a scorer
[10:22] and i think it's reflected in his
[10:23] willingness to pull the trigger on
[10:24] outside
[10:25] shots and attack in the post more he was
[10:28] more aggressive taking smaller players
[10:30] to the block and using his size to score
[10:33] over them like this although on these
[10:35] little flip shots
[10:36] he did need a clean look to be effective
[10:39] so instead he regularly busted out hook
[10:42] shots with both hands
[10:44] and his combination of size strength and
[10:46] craftiness
[10:47] made him a serious mismatch against
[10:50] guards down there
[10:51] and yes if you send help he would set up
[10:54] teammates from the block
[10:56] look i'm not a doctor but double teaming
[10:58] magic johnson in the post
[11:00] is not something i'd recommend
[11:03] as kareem faded the lakers actually
[11:06] played
[11:07] more in the half court behind magic
[11:09] their pace was below
[11:10] average from 1987 to 1991 and that's
[11:13] when magic quarterbacks some of the most
[11:14] efficient offenses in nba history
[11:17] in the back half of the 80s the lakers
[11:19] produced the third best offensive
[11:21] stretch since the shot clock
[11:22] in both the regular season and the
[11:24] playoffs
[11:26] defense however was another story
[11:29] johnson often guarded forwards or slower
[11:31] guards to offset his slow foot speed
[11:34] his lack of lateral quickness made him
[11:36] vulnerable on an island
[11:38] and you can see how choppy his
[11:40] side-to-side movement could be sliding
[11:42] in front of a young charles barkley here
[11:45] take a closer look at his footwork he's
[11:47] on his heels a lot
[11:48] gambles with a reach then can't really
[11:50] break well and commits a reckless foul
[11:54] same technique here and he's roasted by
[11:56] a pedestrian point guard
[11:58] although magic rarely had to venture
[11:59] outside 20 feet in the 1980s like this
[12:02] back then sagging way off guards who
[12:05] stood near the line was standard
[12:07] and this buffer helped him avoid
[12:08] breakdowns in these matchups
[12:11] when he played slower forwards his size
[12:13] definitely helped him
[12:15] hear birds not quick enough to beat
[12:16] magic's loping steps
[12:18] and as he lost some quickness at the end
[12:21] of the decade
[12:22] he could be assigned to jump shooting
[12:24] bigs because la's forwards ac green and
[12:26] james worthy
[12:27] were both nimble enough to handle many
[12:29] wings
[12:31] if those big men were to take magic to
[12:33] the post
[12:34] his size offered some resistance
[12:37] although even on the low
[12:38] block his subpar agility and lack of
[12:40] vertical explosion could be exploited
[12:43] he was actually more comfortable double
[12:46] teaming the post
[12:47] where he could dig down and attack big
[12:50] men of that
[12:50] post-centric era although i wouldn't
[12:52] call his hands
[12:54] great they could miss the mark and he
[12:56] would foul on imprecise swipes at times
[12:59] at six foot eight he did make kick out
[13:01] passes a touch harder
[13:03] yet he didn't attack the ball on that
[13:05] first dribble nearly as much as someone
[13:07] like bird
[13:08] often remaining upright on these plays
[13:10] or offering a weak flail at the rock
[13:14] magic's height was more of an asset on
[13:16] entry passes from
[13:17] smaller guards and here comes that
[13:20] pseudo
[13:21] euro step again this is an overhead view
[13:24] of the perks of being tall
[13:26] just throwing his hands up against a
[13:28] smaller guard
[13:29] and deflections like this trigger that
[13:31] vaunted showtime fast break
[13:34] like bird magic also roamed a lot on the
[13:37] edge of the paint
[13:38] so he could slide over on drives like
[13:40] this when he wasn't doubling the post
[13:42] here's a nice sequence where he stays
[13:44] with the cutter and then peels off to
[13:46] help on the action
[13:47] and that deflection saved a boston layup
[13:50] he could also help down on cutters at
[13:52] the rim
[13:53] sniffing this out and doing just enough
[13:55] to disrupt it
[13:56] and this is probably the best defensive
[13:59] play i've seen him make in the late 80s
[14:01] quickly reacting to the past this time
[14:03] and those hands were right on the money
[14:07] yet for all of his court vision magic
[14:09] wasn't always aware of the ball
[14:11] occasionally tunnel visioning on the
[14:13] screening action in front of him
[14:14] as the ball dribbled right past him he
[14:17] also fell asleep every once in a while
[14:20] after a jumper bird beat him over the
[14:22] top twice with this in one game
[14:25] here he is in transition unaware of the
[14:27] threat behind him
[14:28] and he gets a taste of his own medicine
[14:31] but these issues weren't too common his
[14:34] bigger issue in the paint was
[14:35] verticality
[14:37] he often slid over but offered a
[14:39] statuesque resistance
[14:42] and even magic's better rotations
[14:44] weren't always effective
[14:45] because of how floor-bound he was
[14:48] here's a bumpy possession highlighting
[14:50] his two biggest weaknesses
[14:52] he can't contain the guard court side
[14:53] because of his slow feet
[14:55] then he lingers on the edge of the paint
[14:57] and delicately slides to the ball
[14:59] for a foul he rarely contested at the
[15:03] rim in the half court
[15:04] but in transition he was often the first
[15:06] defender back
[15:07] and he might as well have been five foot
[15:10] eight in these situations
[15:12] it's not a huge part of the game either
[15:14] but this is probably the best transition
[15:16] contest
[15:17] i found in countless opportunities his
[15:20] typical approach in these spots was
[15:21] avoiding contact by
[15:23] subtly moving out of the way which
[15:26] preserved magick's body
[15:28] in exchange for paper weight defense
[15:31] zero inch vertical contests rarely work
[15:35] he didn't block many shots during this
[15:37] period and when he did catch one it was
[15:38] using that same low block technique we
[15:41] saw from bird
[15:42] targeting the ball while it's in the
[15:43] hand still and it's amazing to me how
[15:46] similar yet different these two were
[15:48] neither was suited to stay with quick
[15:50] perimeter players
[15:51] and they often roamed around on defense
[15:54] taking advantage of the compressed game
[15:55] back then
[15:57] bird pushed boundaries as an off ball
[15:58] post player and shooter
[16:00] while magic cranked the dial up with his
[16:02] on-ball passing and speed game
[16:05] and they also played next to hall of
[16:07] fame centers and while kevin mchale is
[16:09] rightfully heralded as an artist in the
[16:11] post
[16:12] james worthy was an isolation machine
[16:15] worthy blended perfectly with magic as
[16:17] kareem faded
[16:18] providing a more dynamic half-court
[16:21] backup plan
[16:22] note how many great magic passes are off
[16:24] a worthy cut
[16:25] and of course big game james was
[16:27] incredible running the wing in
[16:28] transition
[16:30] unfortunately we can't really examine
[16:32] their missed time during the 80s
[16:34] because magic and his teammates were so
[16:36] healthy but
[16:37] the more comprehensive approach we used
[16:39] in episode 1
[16:40] that figured out a player's impact on
[16:42] his team ranks magic
[16:44] second all time reinforcing
[16:47] at the very least that he was having
[16:49] monster offensive
[16:51] impact all in one metrics also view his
[16:54] peak as one of history's very best
[16:56] if we use 1986 instead of 1989 here he's
[16:59] actually
[16:59] fifth in both stats but i don't think
[17:02] there's enough of a defensive boost from
[17:04] that 86 season
[17:05] to outweigh his increased offensive
[17:07] aggression
[17:08] at the end of the decade remember that
[17:11] aggression
[17:12] only enhanced his playmaking the
[17:14] opposite phenomenon we discussed with
[17:16] will chamberlain in episode
[17:18] 1. magic scored less than wilt
[17:21] but was a far more dominant weapon
[17:24] because he maximized his playmaking
[17:26] off of his scoring he did this with near
[17:29] optimal shot selection as well rarely
[17:32] ever
[17:32] forcing low percentage attempts or
[17:34] settling for something easy before
[17:36] testing the defense
[17:38] magix also viewed as a good rebounder
[17:40] because of his six or seven boards a
[17:42] game
[17:43] well listed as a point guard but he was
[17:45] functionally closer to a wing
[17:47] and wasn't overly physical boxing out
[17:49] big men when switching on to them
[17:52] and while there might have been a
[17:53] tactical advantage to him cleaning the
[17:55] glass to start the fast break
[17:57] i think this kind of rebounding only
[17:59] added a little defensive value
[18:02] i do think he could string together
[18:04] decent possessions in the moments where
[18:06] his motor was revved up
[18:08] but it's hard to view him as much of a
[18:09] positive on that
[18:11] end instead the offense is
[18:14] so good it elevates him among the
[18:17] legends by itself
[18:18] his game does come with a small
[18:20] trade-off he was significantly less
[18:22] effective without monopolizing the
[18:23] basketball
[18:24] meaning any other on-ball star wouldn't
[18:27] fit well
[18:28] next to him but with post pieces or
[18:31] good finishers he basically guaranteed
[18:33] you a championship level offense
[18:36] and that means despite only scoring 20
[18:38] points per game
[18:39] magic johnson has a strong case
[18:42] as the greatest offensive player of all
[18:45] time

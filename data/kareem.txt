[00:00] kareem abdul-jabbar was a seven foot two
[00:03] basketball unicorn
[00:05] an ideal offensive centerpiece who could
[00:07] score
[00:08] and pass combined with a looming
[00:10] defensive presence in front of the rim
[00:12] he's arguably the sport's most decorated
[00:15] player three titles in college
[00:17] six in the nba and a record six mvp
[00:20] trophies
[00:21] thanks to the game's most dominant
[00:22] weapon but was he just the product of a
[00:25] weak
[00:25] era were his defensive criticisms valid
[00:29] or when he put it all together at the
[00:31] peak of his powers
[00:33] was he the best center of all time
[00:36] you are watching what greatness is all
[00:39] about
[00:40] where's larry bird in all this has it
[00:43] [Applause]
[00:47] this series tackles one question who was
[00:50] the best
[00:50] at his best we started the aba merger
[00:53] and go through the best
[00:54] multi-year stretches examining the
[00:56] legends who provided the most
[00:58] on court impact these are the greatest
[01:10] peaks
[01:14] [Applause]
[01:18] as a 1960s phenom in new york city
[01:21] kareem was friendly with wilt
[01:23] chamberlain who we examined in the
[01:24] series prelude but he wasn't built to
[01:26] replicate wilt's powerful scoring style
[01:29] jabbar's approach was crafted around his
[01:32] incredible height
[01:32] and graceful agility he easily could
[01:35] have been listed at 7-3 or 7-4
[01:37] if measured in shoes but he wasn't some
[01:40] uncoordinated ant
[01:41] instead moving like a smaller player
[01:44] that athletic combination was enough in
[01:46] high school
[01:46] he won two national titles and in
[01:48] college winning three national titles
[01:50] and famously bludgeoning the defending
[01:52] national champ varsity team at ucla
[01:55] with his freshman squad but to become a
[01:58] legend in the nba jabar needed a weapon
[02:01] that matched his physical makeup
[02:04] that's right the sky hook this cloud
[02:07] scraping dance step was a
[02:09] basketball cheat code we don't have
[02:12] tracking data on
[02:13] every one who flicked up over the years
[02:14] but by my eye it grew
[02:16] sharper sturdier and more accurate as
[02:18] the 70s progressed
[02:20] kareem began adding weight to his lower
[02:22] body through the years
[02:23] and by 1977 still had similar mobility
[02:26] to his college days
[02:27] with a much sturdier base
[02:30] in his earlier years physical defenders
[02:32] could interfere with his setup
[02:34] that melodic left foot step to turn
[02:37] those shoulders at just the right launch
[02:39] angle
[02:40] you can see his balance is disrupted
[02:42] here but by 1977
[02:44] another 10 or 15 pounds on his frame
[02:46] allowed him to find and hold his spots
[02:48] more easily
[02:49] and he could comfortably hook right into
[02:51] defenders when crowded
[02:54] we might take it for granted because it
[02:55] appears effortless
[02:57] but it took years of samurai precision
[03:00] to forge this unique basketball sword
[03:03] defense has tried to stop it by blocking
[03:05] that left foot step
[03:06] but kareem could just step up court away
[03:09] from the hoop
[03:10] almost like his version of a step back
[03:12] disrupting his rhythm or landing space
[03:14] could throw off the accuracy
[03:16] that's a foul today but not then but
[03:18] otherwise this was a high percentage
[03:20] attempt from just about anywhere
[03:22] inside 15 feet as teams
[03:25] overplayed the hook kareem developed
[03:27] counters like a turnaround jumper
[03:29] this probably felt like a win to most
[03:31] defenders but with a high release point
[03:33] it was another viable weapon
[03:36] he also went to a lefty hook although it
[03:38] lacked the devastation of the polished
[03:40] right-hander
[03:41] kareem also had that classic big man
[03:44] game like
[03:45] finding deep position or using his size
[03:48] to just
[03:48] turn and shoot right over smaller
[03:50] defenders
[03:51] sometimes he'd just bust out a spin and
[03:54] drop the
[03:55] hammer who says big men are boring show
[03:57] yourself
[03:58] this repertoire made abdul-jabbar the
[04:00] gold standard of scoring for the first
[04:02] 40 years of the league
[04:04] if we adjust for inflation to today's
[04:06] norms from 1977 to 1979
[04:09] kareem averaged 28 points every 75
[04:12] possessions in the playoffs
[04:14] on efficiency 11 and a half percent
[04:16] better than the opponent's defense
[04:18] only reggie miller has ever touched that
[04:21] kind of true shooting
[04:22] on such volume in the postseason and
[04:24] only three players ever have scored at
[04:26] least 30
[04:27] on plus seven percent true shooting
[04:30] this record-setting scoring forced
[04:32] opponents to react
[04:34] which meant kareem could set up his
[04:35] teammates entire defenses bent toward
[04:38] him
[04:39] there's four in his airspace and since
[04:41] the 77 lakers lacked players who could
[04:43] create their own offense
[04:45] a few extra feet for a jumper made a
[04:47] difference he could skip it cross-court
[04:49] like this
[04:49] to find an open opportunity new laker
[04:52] coach jerry west constructed an attack
[04:54] where kareem was flanked with shooters
[04:56] who could benefit from his double teams
[04:58] which wasn't as destructive as today's
[05:00] three-point specialist
[05:02] but still provided value for secondary
[05:04] players back then
[05:05] without the ball jabar even generated
[05:08] gravity because defenders were so
[05:10] preoccupied with him
[05:12] during their 77 showdown bill walton was
[05:15] reluctant to leave jabar at times
[05:17] he's preoccupied with his movement here
[05:19] instead of his usual help at the rim
[05:22] and here's walton just face guarding him
[05:24] with a second defender dragged over
[05:26] creating another open jumper
[05:29] kareem was also prolific finding cutters
[05:31] from these scoring hot spots
[05:33] he wasn't the high post quarterback
[05:35] walton was bill probably connects there
[05:38] and he didn't have perfect feel for
[05:40] tight ones like this but
[05:41] jabbar had his share of impressive dimes
[05:46] it didn't always feel organic but he was
[05:49] such a studious player that once he
[05:50] learned a situation he could exploit it
[05:54] kareem hit most of these little back
[05:56] doors
[05:57] and was comfortable with handoffs as
[06:00] well
[06:01] and these late prime years were arguably
[06:03] his best as a passer
[06:05] i think this play from his last great
[06:06] offensive season in 1980
[06:08] sums him up as a playmaker finding a
[06:10] teammate cross court
[06:12] then taking a second but still finding a
[06:14] great layup pass
[06:16] he was also a strong outlet passer
[06:19] firing like an
[06:20] outfielder when he could set up a
[06:21] teammate streaking down the court after
[06:23] a rebound
[06:24] kareem's childhood love of baseball no
[06:26] doubt influenced this pass
[06:28] slinging bombs nearly the length of the
[06:30] court at times and these one-handed
[06:32] outlets are a forgotten part of his game
[06:35] all of this took him two heights wilt
[06:37] could never reach on offense
[06:39] he was a more efficient scorer because
[06:41] of far better free throw shooting
[06:43] and he leveraged his scoring to help
[06:45] teammates
[06:46] this guard is sitting on kareem's hook
[06:49] so he audibles to an open
[06:50] shooter also this might be my favorite
[06:53] cream play ever where he fakes the guard
[06:55] off his hook just to set it up and look
[06:57] he slaps his hands in disgust at the
[06:59] mere idea that he gave up a hook
[07:02] using our best estimates jabbar created
[07:05] five to six
[07:06] open shots per game for teammates like
[07:07] this by drawing extra defenders
[07:10] cream of the crop numbers until the late
[07:12] 80s when superstars reached
[07:14] 8 or 9 shots created per game and that
[07:16] gravity made things easier for teammates
[07:19] too
[07:20] wilt would often park himself on the
[07:22] block and clog
[07:23] any driving lanes but kareem could flow
[07:26] into different spots in the paint to
[07:27] catch and score
[07:28] and this offensive variety allowed
[07:30] teammates to fit more comfortably around
[07:32] his post game
[07:34] from 1977 to 79 the leakers finished
[07:37] about two points ahead of league average
[07:39] on offense
[07:40] without an abundance of offensive talent
[07:42] a testament to kareem's ability to
[07:44] raise a team's offensive floor but jabar
[07:48] also fit next to better players on
[07:49] championship level attacks in 1980 when
[07:52] more talent arrived with jim jones
[07:54] michael cooper and magic johnson
[07:56] and in the early 70s with the box next
[07:58] to bobby dandridge and the aging oscar
[08:00] robertson
[08:01] robertson missed 18 games in 1973 and 74
[08:05] and the bucks actually improved their
[08:07] scoring differential by three points
[08:08] without him
[08:09] playing around a 70 win pace strong
[08:12] evidence that
[08:13] prime kareem could captain an elite
[08:15] offense with decent perimeter talent
[08:17] around him
[08:18] while i don't think he could have
[08:19] replicated walton's high post passing in
[08:22] portland's system
[08:23] the lakers offense in 1977 with its own
[08:26] cast of dependent players around jabbar
[08:28] was almost as efficient as the blazers
[08:31] and
[08:32] no big man could replicate those
[08:34] high-end offenses built around kareem
[08:36] for decades here's every offense since
[08:40] 1955
[08:41] where the team leader in offensive load
[08:43] that is the player doing the most heavy
[08:45] lifting
[08:46] was a big man those high-end offenses
[08:49] built around the sky hooks stand out
[08:51] and cream's teams stayed above water
[08:53] when the surrounding talent was bare
[08:55] it's only in the mid 90s that names like
[08:57] barkley malone and shaq
[08:59] led comparable regular season offenses
[09:01] that were built around
[09:02] big men the bigger question about abdul
[09:05] jabar back then
[09:06] and historically is more about his
[09:08] defense and
[09:10] how much it actually held him back
[09:15] i think you're the greatest but my dad
[09:17] says you don't work hard enough on
[09:18] defense
[09:21] 30 years after retiring kareem is still
[09:23] third
[09:24] all-time in block shots despite the stat
[09:26] not being tracked in his first four
[09:28] seasons
[09:29] that incredible length helped him defend
[09:31] the rim well
[09:32] making basic shots difficult for
[09:34] finishers with his giant swat
[09:36] radius and on some of these rim contests
[09:38] he got
[09:39] way up there's another one of those
[09:42] baseball outlets for an easy score
[09:44] but he occasionally had problems judging
[09:47] goaltending when he was so high kareem
[09:50] loved to spring off his left foot like
[09:52] this
[09:52] taking a big plant step and extending
[09:55] the right hand to slap the ball
[09:57] and that made for some incredible saves
[09:59] look at how gracefully he recovers for
[10:01] this chase down block
[10:03] the downside of this left leg right hand
[10:06] two step
[10:06] is that it requires time to unwind and
[10:09] in more traditional vertical situations
[10:11] he couldn't always target releases
[10:13] perfectly
[10:14] at times he's organizing his feet to
[10:16] jump but then an extra dribble throws
[10:18] him off and he can't react in time
[10:21] same thing here a touch late responding
[10:23] so the window to load up and jump is too
[10:25] small and that
[10:26] is kobe bryant's dad ladies and
[10:28] gentlemen
[10:30] reaction time was an issue for kareem he
[10:33] bites on a fake here and then lacks a
[10:35] quick burst from two feet
[10:36] without clearly seeing the shot this
[10:39] entire play he's a frame behind
[10:41] the head turning to the ball late frozen
[10:43] by the pump fake
[10:44] then swiping at air after the ball's
[10:46] gone this is a subtle
[10:48] issue but pedestrian reflexes chipped
[10:50] away at some of his defensive value
[10:53] here's one where his hands are down and
[10:55] he's frozen expecting a shot not a pass
[10:57] but again that lag and reaction time
[10:59] prevents a possible save
[11:01] his motor played a role too he logs so
[11:04] many minutes with a heavy offensive load
[11:06] that there wasn't gas left in the tank
[11:08] for bouncing around
[11:09] on every single defensive trip
[11:12] this shows up in his defensive
[11:14] rebounding where he was notably
[11:16] inconsistent about boxing out
[11:18] often just relying on his huge reach to
[11:20] grab boards
[11:22] his size alone made him a good rebounder
[11:24] but a higher revving engine would have
[11:26] made him a great one
[11:28] in those moments he shifted into
[11:29] overdrive the flashes were impressive
[11:32] blending his size and athleticism into a
[11:34] human wall
[11:35] at the basket his hands weren't always
[11:38] up but he could make great plays with
[11:40] that length
[11:41] when he was determined to react and put
[11:43] forth multiple efforts on a play
[11:46] also legendary traveling signal kareem
[11:49] didn't have many
[11:50] overt defensive breakdowns and even when
[11:53] seeding ground he could still reach many
[11:56] shots
[11:57] so many of those were long distance
[11:59] blocks the
[12:00] kind that erase an attempt but don't
[12:02] prevent one
[12:03] the very best paint defenders deter the
[12:05] highest percentage shots from even being
[12:07] taken
[12:08] and so it's ironic that kareem averaged
[12:10] more blocks per game than bill walton
[12:12] while appearing to contest fewer shots
[12:15] some of kareem's best defensive
[12:17] possessions weren't even blocks
[12:19] here he alters rick berry's attempt and
[12:21] then defending the pass
[12:22] freezes barry into a travel abdul-jabbar
[12:26] was also fairly mobile outside the paint
[12:28] for his time
[12:29] there just weren't many jitterbugs who
[12:31] could punish him on switches
[12:33] although again there's no second effort
[12:35] here for a rebound
[12:36] and it's a putback score yet these
[12:39] old-school pick and rolls were a
[12:41] strength of his
[12:42] sliding down to help or sometimes out to
[12:44] a guard when needed
[12:46] and moving with him comfortably his feet
[12:48] weren't cat quick
[12:49] but his general mobility was superb in
[12:52] these spots
[12:53] for his era he wasn't always aware of
[12:57] all the threats around him
[12:58] he telescopes in on the ball here but
[13:01] completely loses his man behind him
[13:03] although his strong rim protection
[13:05] clearly made him a defensive
[13:07] asset if we examined kareem's missed
[13:10] games in the middle of the 1970s
[13:12] the same method from last episode we can
[13:14] estimate
[13:15] just how impactful his defense and
[13:16] overall game were
[13:18] in 37 missed games kareem's team
[13:21] stumbled to a negative 2.9
[13:23] adjusted point differential about a
[13:25] 32-win pace for a season
[13:27] and with him they played it a positive
[13:29] 3.6 differential
[13:31] or a 52 win pace it's not quite the
[13:34] absurdity of walton's unique impact in
[13:36] portland
[13:37] but the story is the same in both
[13:39] milwaukee in 1975
[13:41] and la in 1978 making it less likely he
[13:44] was situationally lucky
[13:46] and that his impact was in line with the
[13:48] all-time greats
[13:49] in a highly competitive league in the
[13:51] middle of the 70s with teams packed
[13:53] together
[13:54] kareem's two-way value lifted likely
[13:56] lottery teams
[13:57] to fringe contenders status by the way
[14:00] we have to take some liberties with
[14:01] those 1978 games he missed because
[14:04] la made a number of trades afterwards
[14:06] but that seems fair given how those
[14:08] other pieces didn't move the needle
[14:10] for instance in 28 games without jamal
[14:12] wilkes the lakers were even
[14:14] better playing at a 55 win pace
[14:17] adrian dantly's fit on the team was also
[14:20] questionable
[14:21] eating away post-possessions from kareem
[14:24] without jabbar those teams primarily
[14:26] suffered on offense
[14:27] echoing what we see on tape his defense
[14:30] is still good enough though to include
[14:32] him among the sacred
[14:33] peaks we should also note that his post
[14:36] defense had similar strengths and
[14:38] weaknesses to his paint help
[14:39] his size definitely bothered big men who
[14:42] couldn't stretch him away from the hoop
[14:43] but he avoided
[14:44] banging a lot see that little separation
[14:47] he yields
[14:48] and again the reaction is a bit slow on
[14:50] this turnaround
[14:51] here's a clear look notice how he pulls
[14:54] away with his hips instead of holding
[14:56] ground
[14:56] and that's a decent contest but this
[14:59] technique allows for too much freedom
[15:00] and space and can easily backfire
[15:03] hey it's big red if we ran the same
[15:06] numbers for kareem that we did for
[15:08] walton
[15:08] against all-star centers in the
[15:10] mid-1970s the results would be more
[15:12] pedestrian
[15:13] he shaved about two points off their
[15:15] normal true shooting
[15:16] although remember kareem never really
[15:18] had a bruising partner like maurice
[15:20] lucas to play alongside of
[15:23] off-court personality aside it's easy to
[15:25] see how kareem's defensive weaknesses
[15:27] and his cheat code often could produce
[15:30] criticism
[15:31] despite incredible on-court results he
[15:34] simply made it look
[15:35] too easy at times in many ways his
[15:37] outlying height
[15:38] dexterity and studiousness made him the
[15:41] ideal two-way player of his
[15:43] time big man defense combined with
[15:45] offensive impact that wings struggled to
[15:48] match before the spacing of the
[15:49] three-point
[15:50] era our one-number metrics that reach
[15:53] back in time
[15:54] have him competing with just about the
[15:56] best multi-year stretches on
[15:57] record pipm also has him in the top 10
[16:00] here
[16:01] using 1976-1978
[16:04] sure he could have had a better motor or
[16:06] sharper reflexes
[16:08] but that might have just been unfair he
[16:10] won 6 mvps anyway
[16:12] and made 11 all defensive teams most of
[16:15] them warranted in my estimation
[16:17] and so for me he might have peaked on
[16:19] defense in milwaukee
[16:21] with those younger legs under him but
[16:23] the ascension of his offensive game
[16:25] the robotic soul-sucking mastery of the
[16:28] sky hook
[16:29] and that arsenal of counters make kareem
[16:32] abdul-jabbar
[16:33] one of the five best centers in nba

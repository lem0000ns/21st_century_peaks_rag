[00:00] the hardest thing to figure out about
[00:01] lebron james at his peak
[00:04] might just be when exactly he peaked
[00:07] lebron hit another gear in the 2009
[00:10] season
[00:10] winning his first mvp and authoring one
[00:13] of the most incredible statistical
[00:14] profiles in nba
[00:16] history at 24 he had the perfect blend
[00:20] of youthful speed
[00:21] and explosive power and in his second
[00:24] tour of northeast ohio
[00:26] lebron's offensive mastery produced
[00:28] incredible playoff moments
[00:30] and those seasons are great choices but
[00:33] during those championship seasons in
[00:35] south beach
[00:36] his ability to do almost everything
[00:38] might have taken him to heights
[00:40] that no one has ever reached
[00:44] you are watching what greatness is all
[00:47] about
[00:48] where's larry bird in all this has it
[00:50] walked by
[00:52] michael jordan saves the day this series
[00:56] tackles
[00:56] one question who was the best at his
[00:59] best
[01:00] we start at the aba merger and go
[01:02] through the best multi-year stretches
[01:04] examining the legends who provided the
[01:06] most on court impact
[01:08] these are the greatest peaks
[01:16] for me it could be compared to michael
[01:18] magic you know kobe
[01:20] all the ones that's making some success
[01:21] in the league you know it's great and
[01:23] i'm
[01:23] just keep working hard and someday it
[01:26] could be another one that could be
[01:27] compared to me
[01:28] from a distance lebron just looked
[01:30] bigger and stronger than
[01:32] other players but zoom in and there's
[01:34] way more going on
[01:36] during those miami years his game was
[01:39] built around getting to the rim
[01:41] and he approached the basket in just
[01:43] about every way imaginable
[01:45] he drops his shoulder goes off his left
[01:48] foot
[01:48] and finishes southpaw here but on this
[01:51] one he dips the shoulder and jumps off
[01:53] two feet to float one in from short
[01:55] range
[01:57] here's another variant he has a runway
[01:59] but springs into a jump stop
[02:01] and fluid adaptable athleticism was
[02:04] key to lebron's finishing prowess of
[02:07] course
[02:08] his size was a huge factor too crossing
[02:10] back to the left
[02:11] and notice how quickly the ball gets to
[02:13] about 10 feet so he can release it away
[02:15] from those long tim duncan arms
[02:18] lebron's mass was arguably more
[02:21] important than his length
[02:22] able to plow through contact from
[02:24] defenders
[02:25] jimmy butler gives lebron a pretty
[02:27] healthy push here and unlike lanky or
[02:29] penetrators it barely derailed the l
[02:32] train
[02:33] and he still has the balance to explode
[02:35] for the stuff
[02:36] lebron was probably the best ever at
[02:39] absorbing blows in midair
[02:41] while still powering up a good shot
[02:43] which requires incredible body awareness
[02:46] and reactivity
[02:47] these reactions are automatic
[02:50] subconscious movements
[02:51] this contact blunts his vertical leap so
[02:54] we adjust by pulling the ball back
[02:56] and arching it over the defender this is
[02:59] unprecedented neurological wiring in
[03:02] such a giant
[03:03] explosive body here he has the instinct
[03:06] to dip his shoulder in front of the
[03:08] defender
[03:08] who bounces off lebron as he organically
[03:11] twists into a layup
[03:14] some of this is just physics a 275 pound
[03:17] body
[03:18] moving at high speeds packs quite a
[03:20] punch
[03:21] paul george goes flying here and again
[03:23] lebron adjusts off his right leg
[03:26] and finishes with the left hand and yes
[03:29] it was reported that james weighed in at
[03:32] 270 something pounds during these
[03:34] seasons
[03:35] slightly heavier than the 250 to 260 he
[03:38] supposedly played at in cleveland
[03:40] a few years prior and that zapped some
[03:43] of his acceleration
[03:45] in 2009 his first step was quicker and
[03:48] his combination of
[03:49] speed and power were at video game
[03:51] levels
[03:52] if we're submitting entries into the
[03:54] all-time highlight competition
[03:56] this first mvp year is the version to
[03:59] nominate
[04:00] but that additional explosiveness was
[04:02] offset by
[04:03] a weaker outside shot a
[04:06] game that wasn't quite as refined and
[04:08] somewhat paradoxically
[04:10] he wasn't a definitively better finisher
[04:12] on his drives back
[04:14] then this is because he developed so
[04:17] many ways to
[04:17] finish at the cup from contorting
[04:20] reverses
[04:21] to little spin moves that finished with
[04:23] a soft push shot
[04:25] lebron was a master of tempo of
[04:28] controlling speeds take this drive into
[04:31] duncan where
[04:32] slowing down is the key to creating
[04:34] space for a gentle finish
[04:36] despite weighing more than carl malone
[04:39] his agility and explosiveness were still
[04:41] guard like and with a screen he was
[04:43] surgical
[04:44] attacking the position of the second
[04:46] defender he leans the wrong way here
[04:49] so lebron rejects the screen and
[04:51] explodes in a straight line
[04:53] yet on this one he feels the defender
[04:56] too far left
[04:57] so he builds momentum going around the
[04:59] pick and then he's an
[05:00] unstoppable freight train and that is
[05:02] just bionic strength and dexterity
[05:05] that would make isaac asimov proud oh
[05:08] yeah
[05:09] there are more subtle tricks too he
[05:12] knows duncan waits to commit to a shot
[05:14] so he up fakes on an explosive jump stop
[05:17] before stepping through for the layup
[05:21] all of this made lebron one of the best
[05:23] finishers
[05:24] ever among qualifying players he has the
[05:27] highest field goal percentage season
[05:28] at the rim this century and since he
[05:31] maintained
[05:32] comparable efficiencies in the playoffs
[05:34] there's a great argument
[05:36] these are the best finishing seasons
[05:38] ever
[05:39] these super powers were only amplified
[05:42] in transition
[05:43] where he could build a head of steam and
[05:45] attack into open space
[05:47] he just shed smaller players like there
[05:49] were mosquitoes
[05:51] this is the android upgrade of what we
[05:53] saw in episode 5 from magic johnson
[05:56] out sprinting everyone and changing
[05:58] directions at high speeds while
[06:00] completely under control
[06:02] size and speed are one thing but
[06:04] lebron's ability to decelerate
[06:06] remain controlled and flow into a move
[06:10] supercharged his fast break scoring he
[06:13] could use those same half-court tools
[06:15] change of tempo varied jumping angles
[06:18] and so on
[06:19] only with a head of steam against
[06:20] backpedaling defenses
[06:22] even with big men in the paint lebron
[06:25] could shift on the fly
[06:27] he's angling toward the middle here but
[06:28] then slides left for two
[06:31] and there is a cerebral component to
[06:33] many of these
[06:34] he throws a head fake to freeze a
[06:36] defender and he's unstoppable with all
[06:38] that space to attack
[06:40] braun did this stuff to great defenders
[06:43] too andre iguodala's hips are
[06:45] facing left here so lebron goes right
[06:48] then andre recovers so he gives him an
[06:50] inside out for the full spin cycle in
[06:53] real time the whole thing is a blur and
[06:55] it's free throws
[06:57] it was basically impossible to slow down
[06:59] james in transition
[07:00] running alongside him or recovering to
[07:03] the paint because of his width and
[07:05] change of direction
[07:06] here the defender is basically even with
[07:08] him but since he's so much smaller
[07:10] he's essentially poster decoration
[07:14] in short lebron was the most devastating
[07:16] transition scorer
[07:17] the league had ever seen and 2012 to 13
[07:21] is the best two-year stretch in
[07:23] synergy's database
[07:24] averaging an insane 1.4 points per
[07:27] possession in transition
[07:29] on over four opportunities a game
[07:31] numbers he nearly replicated to a t
[07:34] in the postseason the totality of all
[07:37] this made lebron
[07:38] one of the best scorers ever with his
[07:41] playoff runs in miami stacking up
[07:43] incredibly well against just about
[07:45] anybody in league history
[07:47] when adjusting for opponent quality
[07:50] another key to lebron's scoring during
[07:52] these years was the development of his
[07:54] post game these plays weren't nearly as
[07:57] deadly as his transition game or half
[08:00] court drives
[08:01] but adding some back to the basket
[08:02] skills kept defenses honest
[08:05] and gave him another arrow in his quiver
[08:08] he often caught it in the midpost and
[08:10] went to work backing down
[08:12] smaller wings and with his size
[08:14] advantage and great balance
[08:16] he could wheel in two shots down low or
[08:19] bust out that
[08:19] spin move that he loved there's a tim
[08:22] duncan-esque use of the off hand to
[08:24] protect the ball
[08:25] against kawhi leonard we often think of
[08:28] great scores
[08:29] as having pretty fadeaways or nasty
[08:31] go-to moves
[08:33] but lebron's physical dominance and
[08:35] fantastic
[08:36] feel carved out hyper efficient shots
[08:39] and he balanced those shots with a
[08:41] respectable outside game
[08:43] this was a shift from his younger years
[08:45] where he was near the bottom of the
[08:47] league in outside shooting percentages
[08:49] but in miami he jumped above league
[08:51] average on his long range
[08:53] shots behind a slightly smoother
[08:56] shooting motion
[08:57] lebron was more patient getting into his
[08:59] jumper and as a result he made about 42
[09:02] of his long twos in miami a step up from
[09:05] the 39 percent he made
[09:07] in his final two years in cleveland
[09:10] he also improved by more than three
[09:12] percentage points from downtown
[09:14] after making only 34 of his threes
[09:16] between 2009 and 2011.
[09:20] so during these seasons lebron's outside
[09:23] shot rounded out his incredible scoring
[09:26] game
[09:27] but that was only half of his offensive
[09:29] equation
[09:30] because his playmaking talents helped
[09:33] take him
[09:34] to another level
[09:38] training in the pool baby we can go
[09:40] anytime you just let me know what's good
[09:41] for you
[09:42] you can't get through detroit training
[09:43] in no pool you think michael train in
[09:46] the pool
[09:47] no i don't think so it's up looking at
[09:49] my lemonade
[09:50] here i come cannonball because
[09:53] lebron was so effective driving to the
[09:55] hoop
[09:56] defenses would counter by packing the
[09:58] paint
[09:59] forcing him to beat them with his jumper
[10:02] dallas did this to some degree in the
[10:04] 2011 finals
[10:06] not overreacting to him as a shooter and
[10:08] then loading up on his drives
[10:11] tyson chandler spies james instead of
[10:13] worrying about the weak side
[10:15] and so two big men are waiting for him
[10:17] in the paint
[10:18] when the mavericks clogged these driving
[10:21] lanes like this
[10:22] they were content with mario chalmers or
[10:24] dwyane wade
[10:25] beating them with outside shots there
[10:28] was more to lebron's huge scoring drop
[10:30] off in that series than just dallas
[10:32] defense but two years later
[10:34] a fantastic spurs team packed the paint
[10:36] again
[10:37] and made lebron's driving gaps as narrow
[10:39] as possible
[10:41] it was common for multiple spurs players
[10:44] to converge on him in the lane
[10:46] and this strategy limited lebron's
[10:47] effectiveness more than any other series
[10:50] between 2012 and 14
[10:52] although that improved jumper still made
[10:55] it a solid scoring series for james
[10:58] and this is where a more diverse scoring
[11:00] arsenal
[11:01] made him so difficult to slow down not
[11:04] only with outside shots
[11:05] but by playing out of the post post play
[11:09] provided a different angle to attack
[11:11] from defenses couldn't really
[11:13] load up on any driving lanes in these
[11:15] spots and because lebron was such a
[11:17] gifted passer
[11:18] it made doubling him down there a bit
[11:20] tricky
[11:21] if teams weren't careful a double team
[11:24] could create
[11:24] short easy kickouts to three-point
[11:27] shooters and a
[11:28] huge part of lebron's offensive value
[11:30] was unlocking
[11:32] long-range marksman out on the perimeter
[11:35] with the spurs clogging the lane lebron
[11:37] sets up a rim finish but it's really a
[11:40] pass
[11:40] and crafty deliveries like this gave
[11:43] shooters optimal breathing room
[11:45] if he didn't throw it early he had the
[11:47] strength to skip it across the court
[11:49] where it was a longer recovery for the
[11:51] defense
[11:52] that's just incredible speed from that
[11:54] position to beat the closeout
[11:57] james might have been the best skip
[11:59] passer the league had ever seen
[12:01] swinging it cross-court to his bandmates
[12:04] and when teams tried to sit in his
[12:06] driving gaps
[12:07] changing sides like this is a natural
[12:09] counter
[12:11] of course lebron also manipulated
[12:13] defenders
[12:14] there's no indication he's passing as he
[12:16] turns the corner here
[12:17] and the look away prevents this defender
[12:20] from playing the passing lane
[12:21] and it's a clean shot he could hit these
[12:24] same passes in transition
[12:26] against a wall of defenders the velocity
[12:29] on that one buys the shooter more time
[12:31] and again he uses his drive to disguise
[12:34] a delivery
[12:35] that move sent kevin garnett in the
[12:37] wrong direction giving mario chalmers
[12:40] all day to shoot that driving pressure
[12:43] and a powerful dribble took him right
[12:45] into the teeth of the defense where he
[12:47] could spray it around to
[12:48] wide open shooters miami shot 38
[12:52] from downtown with lebron on the court
[12:55] in his final three seasons there
[12:57] surrounding him with better three-point
[12:58] weapons and going to smaller stretchier
[13:01] lineups
[13:03] unfortunately their second best player
[13:06] dwayne wade
[13:07] was a poor three-point shooter which
[13:09] wasn't an ideal fit next to james
[13:12] wade was coming off one of the great
[13:14] peaks in league history himself
[13:16] and in many ways was functionally
[13:18] similar to lebron
[13:20] he was a dangerous finisher and
[13:22] difficult to keep out of the lane
[13:24] and he could spearhead an entire offense
[13:26] with a pick and roll game as well
[13:29] in effect this made him lebron's backup
[13:32] because the heat could flank james or
[13:35] wade with
[13:36] identical lineups but since neither of
[13:39] them were really good spot up shooters
[13:41] on possessions initiated by wade lebron
[13:44] was less valuable standing in the corner
[13:47] a good shooter just ends up with a high
[13:49] percentage three there
[13:50] instead even though wade-centric
[13:53] possessions were
[13:54] perfectly effective miami's best offense
[13:57] was lebron ball
[13:58] giving him the keys and letting him make
[14:00] the primary decisions
[14:02] miami actually excelled when james
[14:04] played without his sidekick
[14:06] logging over 40 games without weight
[14:09] during these seasons
[14:10] at a 57 win pace
[14:13] with wade they were only a touch better
[14:16] reaching a 59 win
[14:17] pace and most notably the heat's
[14:20] offensive efficiency
[14:21] was slightly better without duane that
[14:24] heat
[14:25] offense was good in the regular season
[14:27] and fantastic
[14:28] in the playoffs a pattern that is held
[14:31] for lebron's entire prime
[14:33] which is a testament to his scoring and
[14:35] playmaking ability
[14:37] making him the centerpiece of a
[14:39] heliocentric system
[14:41] with the right finishers orbiting around
[14:43] him produced historically good offense
[14:46] because of his decision making for
[14:49] instance take this pop quiz
[14:51] where's the optimal pass congratulations
[14:55] if you found it
[14:56] because the thunder were blindsided by
[14:58] that pass and for good reason
[15:00] we've seen him snap it to this corner if
[15:02] the strong side defender slides over
[15:05] and if he feels the weak side defender
[15:08] leaning toward the roll man
[15:09] he could fire it to the other wing for
[15:11] more target practice
[15:14] some of these require elite reflexes
[15:17] snapping off passes when an opening
[15:19] emerges and here the roll man
[15:21] pops away from the hoop and as lebron
[15:23] looks for him it takes a millisecond
[15:25] before he processes the cut to the
[15:26] basket
[15:27] and delivers a laser great passers not
[15:31] only deliver balls quickly
[15:33] but they camouflage releases from a
[15:35] variety of
[15:36] angles so when lebron touched the paint
[15:39] defenses had little indication of what
[15:41] was coming a kick out to a shooter
[15:43] a drop off to a big man or a score
[15:47] they basically all look the same until
[15:49] the moment the ball leaves his hands
[15:51] and he usually chose the best option
[15:55] all of this takes great spatial
[15:57] awareness tracking multiple defenders
[15:59] so when one moves he knows exactly where
[16:02] to attack
[16:04] great googly moolie this one takes some
[16:07] grand master recognition
[16:09] eyeing an angle with tim duncan's hands
[16:11] down and throwing a rope the second his
[16:14] receiver gets inside position
[16:17] like all high-end passers lebron would
[16:19] try some into tight coverage that didn't
[16:21] pan out
[16:22] and i think his vision and reads
[16:24] improved in later seasons
[16:26] he almost never missed straight forward
[16:28] layups like this one
[16:30] but he could overlook some slightly
[16:32] trickier hookups
[16:33] that's there for the taking and we've
[16:36] seen post players hit this cutter
[16:38] a number of times during this series
[16:41] he also wasn't regularly tossing this
[16:43] lob pass to the roll man back then like
[16:45] he would in subsequent years
[16:47] and sometimes his bounce passes could be
[16:49] a bit tough to handle for his big men
[16:53] still that vision and quick processing
[16:56] led to some spectacular passes in
[16:58] dynamic situations
[17:00] chugging down the court here for a lob
[17:02] and then yes that is exactly what you
[17:04] think a touch pass where he leaves the
[17:07] ball hanging
[17:08] right in front of the rim between his
[17:10] visual processing and that fluid
[17:12] athleticism
[17:14] there were moments where he was almost
[17:15] bird-like with some passes able to
[17:18] anticipate openings
[17:19] and then snap off high-value dimes
[17:23] in transition he was a little magic-like
[17:26] pushing the pace with speed and forcing
[17:29] defenses to commit so he could drop it
[17:31] off
[17:32] this is a three-man wall in the lane to
[17:34] barricade his penetration
[17:36] and that leads to wide open threes and
[17:39] here okc forms a wall at an angle
[17:41] which creates an alley that lebron
[17:43] quickly spots for free throws
[17:46] you might have noticed how many of these
[17:48] assists were to wade
[17:49] he and lebron had really nice chemistry
[17:52] on cuts to the basket
[17:54] and while flash was still a great
[17:56] offensive player in those seasons
[17:58] the more he receded into a secondary
[18:00] role the better lebron's numbers became
[18:04] his shot creation estimates with wade in
[18:06] the game were in the 93rd percentile
[18:08] historically in the playoffs
[18:10] but with weight on the bench they would
[18:12] have ranked eighth
[18:13] all time almost perfectly matching his
[18:16] earlier numbers in cleveland
[18:18] his free throw rates with wade dipped to
[18:20] the 93rd percentile
[18:22] but without him they would have ranked
[18:24] seventh all time
[18:25] again fairly close to his numbers as a
[18:27] cav
[18:28] so as a result lebron scoring went to
[18:31] another
[18:31] stratosphere in those playoffs with his
[18:34] slash brother on the bench
[18:36] surpassing even michael jordan with what
[18:38] would be the best adjusted numbers
[18:40] in playoff history that's not entirely
[18:44] apples to apples comparison
[18:45] but it's part of why the heat offense
[18:47] was more efficient
[18:49] playing a larger brand of lebron ball
[18:52] so while lebron was the centerpiece of
[18:54] an incredibly effective attack
[18:57] all of his athleticism and computational
[18:59] power
[19:00] helped on the other end of the court
[19:02] where he was a key component
[19:04] in miami's defense
[19:09] during their four-year run the heatless
[19:12] frequently attacked ball screens with a
[19:14] second defender
[19:15] which meant other defenders had to
[19:17] scramble behind the play
[19:19] as everyone recovered and this blitzing
[19:22] of the pick and roll created a kind of
[19:25] frenetic approach on defense that
[19:27] required a ton of coordinated rotations
[19:30] and also forced a lot of turnovers
[19:33] sometimes this scheme
[19:34] asks james to sprint across the court to
[19:37] a popping big man
[19:38] this would be an impossible rotation if
[19:40] the screener flared to the three-point
[19:42] line
[19:42] but lebron was so fast in a straight
[19:45] line that he could arrive when these
[19:47] passes did
[19:48] he had great awareness of on-ball
[19:51] threats
[19:52] sliding over to help early here and
[19:54] choking off this pass which leads to
[19:56] another turnover
[19:58] in cleveland james's defensive success
[20:00] was more about
[20:01] brute force athleticism but in miami he
[20:04] played a more cerebral
[20:06] game he isn't preoccupied with this cut
[20:08] because he knows a middle pick and roll
[20:10] is coming
[20:11] and then he's big enough to battle with
[20:13] duncan for the rebound
[20:16] here he needs to help on the roll man
[20:18] but realizes he's in a pickle
[20:20] leaving a wide open three or maybe a
[20:22] dunk so he covers the pass
[20:24] while contesting the mid-range shot he
[20:27] was an
[20:28] active communicator calling out for a
[20:30] switch so his point guard could find a
[20:32] more natural match up
[20:34] then instantly pouncing on a breakdown
[20:36] to help influence a block from shane
[20:38] battier
[20:40] lebron's on a sharpshooter here and he
[20:42] chases him off two screens for a decent
[20:44] look
[20:45] and all that action pulled rebounders
[20:47] out of the paint and it's a foul
[20:49] so the next time down lebron tells
[20:52] battier to take his man coming off the
[20:53] screen
[20:54] switches to the big and just blows the
[20:56] whole thing up
[20:59] because of his size he could comfortably
[21:01] switch onto bigger players like this
[21:03] and guard them in isolation and he could
[21:06] protect the rim like he was a big man as
[21:09] well
[21:10] this wasn't the incredible paint
[21:12] protection we've seen from the great
[21:13] bigs in this series
[21:15] but lebron added a ton of value lurking
[21:18] in the lane
[21:19] and since the heat would often play
[21:20] small ball he was the primary vertical
[21:23] presence
[21:24] in many of these situations he was
[21:27] potent enough as a shot blocker to deter
[21:29] shots
[21:30] duncan freezes when he sees him here and
[21:32] then is totally stuck
[21:34] and some of these were elite rejections
[21:36] that you would see from
[21:38] high-end defensive big men he slides
[21:41] over here in case there's a lay down
[21:43] pass
[21:44] and covers so much ground that he spikes
[21:46] it and this play is spectacular
[21:49] coming from the corner after wade whips
[21:51] on a gamble
[21:52] to kill a dunk now he didn't have the
[21:55] same numbers as a
[21:56] shot blocking big so these plays weren't
[21:58] always the norm
[22:00] sometimes they could be fouls and other
[22:02] times he wasn't quite as
[22:04] loaded up and vertical on some of these
[22:06] contests at the rim
[22:08] but his timely rotations in the paint
[22:10] and this
[22:11] big man-like skill were a major asset
[22:14] for the heat
[22:16] there was a horizontal component to
[22:18] these rotations
[22:19] too he has to cover about 16 feet in the
[22:22] second that this passes airborne
[22:24] and that prevents steph curry from
[22:26] firing and leads to a bad pass and a
[22:29] steal
[22:30] he could play a cross-court pass like
[22:32] this or
[22:33] explode to intercept the roll paths and
[22:36] that closing speed allowed him to be in
[22:38] two places at once
[22:41] these short little bursts of speed
[22:43] allowed him to cover
[22:44] tons of court like a rangy center
[22:47] fielder in baseball
[22:48] and his hands were pretty good too
[22:50] racking up enough steels
[22:52] to land in the 88th percentile
[22:54] historically
[22:56] some of these players on the ball were
[22:58] certainly a bit risky
[22:59] and so there were some occasional misses
[23:01] in there
[23:02] on this one he's in time on the rotation
[23:05] but
[23:06] lunges for more and comes up empty and
[23:08] sometimes he'd sell out for a pick
[23:10] 6 and when those plays failed they often
[23:13] exposed the defense and led to a high
[23:15] value
[23:15] shot but he rarely lost track
[23:19] of the action off ball here's a lapse on
[23:22] some screening set
[23:23] although he was usually pretty aware of
[23:25] his own man and the basketball from the
[23:28] other side of the court
[23:29] so despite a few hiccups he was a fairly
[23:33] low error player
[23:34] away from the ball he was highly
[23:37] knowledgeable of opponents playbooks
[23:38] during these seasons
[23:40] helping early and rotating on point in
[23:42] miami's scrambling scheme
[23:45] and he was even known to call out
[23:46] opposing sets he
[23:48] switches this to blow up indiana's
[23:49] screening action and his pattern
[23:51] recognition skills
[23:52] were also a key to his defensive value
[23:56] that value helped the heat produce
[23:58] quality defensive ratings in the regular
[24:00] season
[24:01] and solid ones in the postseason among
[24:04] regular playoff teams
[24:06] they were about middle of the pack in
[24:08] defensive performance
[24:09] during these years despite playing
[24:11] smaller lineups than most teams at the
[24:14] time
[24:15] lebron also loved rear view blocks
[24:17] recovering
[24:18] to catch players from behind and this
[24:21] was part of his
[24:22] chase down arsenal in transition where
[24:25] he'd just size up smaller players
[24:27] like an adult playing with young
[24:29] children
[24:30] he tried a similar approach in the half
[24:33] court although it was
[24:34] far less effective on drives like this
[24:36] when james
[24:37] lost a step to the dribbler and
[24:40] containing ball handlers in space
[24:42] was probably his biggest defensive
[24:44] weakness
[24:45] it wasn't that lebron couldn't keep
[24:47] quicker or smaller players in front of
[24:49] him
[24:50] he used his length and size to cut off
[24:52] angles well
[24:53] but he also had to guess and react
[24:56] instantly to change directions
[24:58] on stops and starts and he was
[25:00] vulnerable to these because at 270
[25:02] pounds
[25:03] it took a lot to break and re-accelerate
[25:06] in short spaces
[25:09] his technique worked really well
[25:11] whenever those little hops and reactions
[25:13] were on
[25:14] time and in the right direction but if
[25:16] his feet were off the ground when his
[25:18] man started to go
[25:19] he couldn't laterally recover at his
[25:21] size
[25:23] this made lebron an interesting on-ball
[25:25] defender
[25:26] because he regularly broke down to
[25:28] change of direction attacks
[25:30] but when he sized it up well he could
[25:32] keep really small guards in front of him
[25:35] he was fairly successful switched on to
[25:38] the shifty tony parker in the 2013
[25:40] finals
[25:41] and he was big enough to then switch
[25:43] onto duncan and stonewall him in the
[25:45] post
[25:47] another downside to being so big was
[25:49] that navigating screens was a tricky
[25:51] endeavor
[25:52] james didn't have that sharp cornering
[25:54] required to stick with some of these
[25:56] routes
[25:56] and he couldn't really slide that much
[25:58] weight or rely on tap dancing feet
[26:01] to slip by some picks you see him go
[26:05] wide here so he can chase with more of a
[26:07] running motion versus sliding and
[26:10] because he was so
[26:10] broad he offered a large screening
[26:13] target
[26:14] which made it challenging for him to
[26:15] stay with smaller players
[26:17] when they ran around like this all the
[26:20] major one number metrics
[26:22] view lebron as a strong defender and
[26:24] with his huge offensive value
[26:27] his overall impact metrics are right at
[26:29] the top of the heap
[26:31] interestingly these numbers were higher
[26:34] in his first two mvp seasons
[26:36] when he was the lone star in cleveland
[26:38] surrounded by
[26:39] outside shooters who gave him space to
[26:41] attack the rim
[26:43] in miami he didn't have the ball as much
[26:45] and his off-ball impact
[26:47] paled in comparison to his on-ball game
[26:50] he could hurt defenses with timely cuts
[26:53] he had good instincts for when to
[26:55] backdoor
[26:55] a vulnerable defender but his spot up
[26:58] shooting was only mediocre
[27:00] and more importantly playing away from
[27:03] the ball
[27:04] took the decision making out of his
[27:06] hands
[27:07] we've discussed scoring resiliency but
[27:10] lebron ball provided an
[27:12] overall resiliency that was difficult to
[27:15] scheme against because
[27:16] he could leverage his scoring and
[27:18] playmaking off of each other
[27:20] he couldn't just plug into any offense
[27:22] and add the same value
[27:24] but a well-constructed attack built
[27:26] around lebron
[27:27] produced a championship level offense
[27:30] his high iq
[27:32] swiss army knife defense also made him
[27:34] one of the better perimeter defenders in
[27:37] league history
[27:38] and that two-way impact probably made
[27:41] him the greatest floor raiser we've ever
[27:43] seen
[27:45] so given that he has a great argument
[27:48] as a top 10 scorer and top 10 playmaker
[27:51] ever
[27:52] it's easy to see why so many people
[27:55] consider lebron james
[27:57] the greatest player of all time
